The sad thing is, the student stole the textbook because he could not afford it. Mr. Tan decided to change some things around.\n\nInstead of making his students buy the textbook, Mr. Tan made copies of the textbook and gave them to the students. This is technically illegal. Another teacher found out about what Mr. Tan was doing and told the principal. The principal gave Mr. Tan a warning. Mr. Tan had to come up with another idea that was legal.\n\nMr. Tan decided to use online articles that were available for everyone to access.

Because she shops so much, her house was getting cluttered.\n\nHer mom and dad restricted her access to money by closing her debit and credit card accounts. They also stopped giving her an allowance. This did not stop Janet from shopping. In fact, things got even worse. Janet started shoplifting. She was really good at it, too. For clothes, she would just go into the fitting room and put them in her bag. Fitting rooms did not have surveillance cameras, so that was why she could do that. School supplies were even easier to steal. Janet just looked around her and put the pens in her pocket. Electronics were difficult to steal, so she never tried.\n\nJanet saw a necklace she liked. As usual, she went to the fitting room and placed it in her bag. When she exited the store, the alarm went off. Janet was shocked as that had never happened to her. An employee checked her bag and pulled out the necklace from her bag. It turned out that there was a security tag.",

Elliot had tickets to his sold-out concert in San Francisco. It was the first time he would see him in person. He also had backstage tickets so he could talk to him.\n\nElliot drove to San Francisco with some friends to see the Cooker. They had pretty good seats. They could see his sweat! The Cooker was great live. His voice sounded the same as it did on the radio. Some singers can't sing live. The Cooker wasn't one of them. Elliot waved his hands up in the air. He closed his eyes and listened to the music.\n\nAfter the concert, Elliot and his friends went backstage. Elliot was so excited that he screamed when he saw the Cooker. The Cooker closed his ears. Elliot ran up to him. \"I am your biggest fan! Can I have an autograph and a picture?\" Elliot asked. The Cooker rolled his eyes. \"Sure, I guess.\" Elliot noticed that the Cooker was annoyed. \"You know what, forget it. I don't want a jerk's autograph,\" Elliot said. He realized that some celebrities were just mean.",

George thought the water truck would save the houses from fires. The water truck held 2,000 gallons of water. It cost $50,000. \"That's a lot of money. But if it saves our homes from a fire, it's worth every penny,\" he told his neighbors. They all agreed with him. One year later, the woods were on fire. George sprayed water on all the houses.

She thinks she got her smooth skin from her parents. She also might have smooth skin because she drinks a lot of water.\n\nHaving acne is tough because teenagers care a lot about their appearance and what other people think of them. Having acne can cause people to feel bad about themselves, shy away from others, and not go out. Melinda doesn't have this problem, but her sister, Ivana, does. Ivana didn't understand why she had acne, because no one in her family had it. Ivana ate fairly healthy, too. She felt like she was just unlucky. Because of her acne, Ivana felt insecure about herself. It was hard for her to be confident. She always tried to avoid attention. She barely talked to anyone.\n\nIvana decided to try ProActiv because she kept seeing it on TV. It ended up improving her skin. It was less red and bumpy. Meanwhile, Melinda got her very first pimple, and it was on the day of her big speech in class! It was horrible timing. That's the thing about pimples though, they just appear out of nowhere!",

Lillian and her friends decide to try the Fireball Wings at a popular chicken wing place in their town. The Fireball Wings were supposed to be so spicy that you could still feel the burn after one hour of eating a bite.\n\nLillian and her friends had to sign a waiver to eat the wings so that they couldn't sue the business if they had any health problems after eating the wings. Lillian was excited. Finally the plate of wings came in, and everyone could smell the chilli. One of her friends sneezed because the smell was so strong.\n\nLillian took the first bite. It was hot! She started panting and breathing heavily. She drank some water, but it was still hot. Her friends ordered some milk for her. Milk is supposed to be good for dealing with spicy food. Lillian drank two glasses of milk, but her mouth was still burning. Her friends decided not to eat the wings, because if Lillian couldn't handle it, then they surely wouldn't!",

Why was Ms. Robins so terrible? Well, she never wanted to be a teacher. She grew up wanting to be an actress. She was pretty good at it. She even had her own TV show once. The TV show did not do so well, and it ended after a year. Ms. Robins struggled to find a job after that.\n\nMs. Robins only got her job as a teacher because she knew the principal of the school. They were best friends from high school. Ms. Robins taught history. Her students were all afraid of her. One of the students, Cassidy, raised her hand to ask a question. \"Ms. Robins, how long should our essay be?\" Ms. Robins stared at her coldly and said, \"I hate repeating myself. Ask your classmate.\"\n\nMs. Robins was called into the principal's office. \"What's up?\" she asked. \"There have been some concerns over your behavior,\" the principal said. \"I know where this is going,\" Ms. Robins said. \"Do you? Well, it has to change. I know you don't want to be here, but you can't get paid if all your students want you gone,\" the principal said. Ms. Robins was more careful since her meeting with the principal.",

    "story": "A lot of kids are smart. The thing that stops them from getting an A is procrastination. Procrastination is putting things off to a later time. An example of procrastination would be starting a project one day before it is due. Procrastinating is bad, because it makes a person stressed out. It is also bad, because the end product is usually not very good.\n\nSince studying is not very fun, students put video games, hanging out with friends, and eating out before studying. They end up studying the night before the test and do not get much sleep. This is bad, because eight hours of sleep or more is needed to do well. Students who procrastinate end up doing badly on tests. Teachers always encourage students to start early and do a little bit of studying every day.\n\nProcrastination does not just happen in school, it happens everywhere. People put off going to the doctor, applying for jobs, and more. Some people say that procrastination is just human nature. However, some people say that they do well when they procrastinate. They say that stress makes them work faster.",
