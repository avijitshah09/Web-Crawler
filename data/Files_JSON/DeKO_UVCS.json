This naval tree produced more fruit than any other tree in the jungle, and its fruit was fresher and sweeter than the fruit on all the other trees.Every day when the monkey ate this fruit, he was very happy. Not only could he eat his fill, but he could throw some fruit into the river when his friend the crocodile came by. The crocodile and the monkey spent many hours sitting on the shore of the river and talking, and in time they became best friends.The crocodile always took some fruit home to his dear wife. She loved the naval fruit so much that she became addicted to its taste and freshness. One day she thought, \u201cIf the monkey eats this fruit every day, then his flesh must also taste sweet, especially his liver. Oh, I want to taste the monkey\u2019s liver.\u201d She thought about it and thought about it until she couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.Finally she said to her husband, \u201cI want to taste the monkey\u2019s liver. Please bring him home, so I can satisfy my hunger.\u201dThe crocodile was shocked! \u201cYou want to eat the monkey\u2019s liver? But . . . he\u2019s my friend! I love him. And he\u2019s so generous to us. My dear, it\u2019s impossible.\u201dThe lady crocodile became angry. She demanded that he bring the monkey to her. She demanded that he let her taste the monkey\u2019s liver. Otherwise she would leave.The crocodile was torn apart. He loved his wife, and didn\u2019t want to lose her. He loved his friend, and didn\u2019t want to lose him. Why did he have to make this difficult choice?In the end, he decided to lose his monkey friend. With a heavy heart, he swam slowly back across the river and sat under the naval tree.\u201cOh Monkey,\u201d he called, \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely night, and I feel like going for a ride on the river. Why don\u2019t you come along? I could show you the beauty of the river.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said the monkey. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. And anyway, I can\u2019t swim, and I\u2019m afraid of the water.\u201d\u201cI am the king of the river. You don\u2019t need to be afraid when you ride on my back. Besides, we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. What a shame it would be if you can\u2019t trust me by now.\u201dThe monkey thought for a minute. Perhaps the crocodile was right. Who can you trust, if not your friends? \u201cOK,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d He jumped onto the crocodile\u2019s back, and they sailed into the river.It was a wonderful ride, and the monkey was really happy, but the crocodile was quiet, and deep in thought.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked the monkey.The crocodile almost burst into tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my friend. I lied to you. I am not doing this to entertain you. Rather, I am taking you to my wife. She wants to eat your liver.\u201d\u201cEat my liver!!\u201d The monkey was astonished. \u201cWhy does she want to eat my liver?\u201d\u201cShe knows that you eat the fruit of the naval tree every day. She thinks that your liver must be very sweet and tender, so she wants to eat it.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d said the monkey. He saw that his life was in danger. He thought for a minute. \u201cMy friend, don\u2019t feel bad on my account,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be honored to give my liver to your wife. But you should have told me about this before we left the naval tree.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d asked the crocodile.\u201cWell, I always wash my liver in the river and then hang it on a branch of the tree.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cIf you take me back to the tree, I\u2019ll get it for you. Then you can take it to your wife.\u201dThe crocodile swam quickly back to the naval tree. When he got to the shore, the monkey jumped off his back and climbed up the tree.\u201cHah! Crocodile! Don\u2019t you know that I can\u2019t give you my liver? This has been a good lesson to me about trust.\u201d",

    "story": "Do you believe that a kilogram of carrots could cost $10,000? My carrots cost me that much last year. Last summer I had to completely renovate my kitchen and it was all because of a bunch of carrots. The story begins with my picking twelve carrots from my vegetable garden and ends with my getting a new kitchen.I have a vegetable garden and every summer I enjoy eating my own vegetables. One day last summer I picked a dozen carrots. Usually, as soon as I have picked the carrots, I clean the dirt off them by rinsing them in a bucket of water. I keep a full bucket of water beside the garden just for this purpose. But this day, as I was getting up from the ground with my twelve carrots, I tripped and fell over the bucket. The water spilled out of the bucket and went all over my feet. I ran into the house to change my shoes and socks. When I was finally dry and clean, I realized that I had very little time to make dinner. The carrots were part of dinner, so I decided to wash the carrots quickly in the kitchen sink. The carrots were covered in a large amount of dirt from the garden. I put the carrots in the sink, rinsed them with water, and watched all the dirt wash away down the drain.The next day, when I was washing dishes, I noticed that the water drained out of the sink much more slowly than usual. It drained so slowly that I went to the store and bought a bottle of special drain cleaner. I used the drain cleaner and the water seemed to drain a little faster. However, the following day the drain worked even more slowly. I spent $100 on different kinds of drain cleaner. None of them worked.Soon the water did not drain at all. At this point I called a plumber to come and fix my drain. The plumber tried a lot of different cleaners and equipment, but nothing worked. He tried to go under the house to check the pipes, but he couldn't reach them. He had to cut a hole in the floor where the drain pipe was in order to try to find the problem. While he was cutting the small hole, he accidentally cut the hot-water pipe. Hot water sprayed over the plumber, onto the floor, behind the counters, under the refrigerator; water went everywhere. Two hours later we finally finished cleaning up all the water. But the water had caused a lot of damage.My refrigerator stopped working because the water had affected the electrical wires. I called an electrician to come and fix the refrigerator. The electrician had to move the refrigerator to work on the wires. In order to move the refrigerator, she had to balance it on an angle and pull it away from the wall. As the electrician was balancing it, she tripped over the plumber's tools. She fell down and the refrigerator tipped over. It crashed into the wall, resulting in a huge hole in the wall.I called a carpenter to come and fix the wall. In order to repair the hole in the wall, the carpenter had to tear down half of the entire wall. When the wall was half gone, the electrician found more electrical problems caused by the water damage. This resulted in the other half of the wall being removed to replace the damaged wiring. Meanwhile, the plumber was still looking for the source of the drain problem. Since the kitchen was in a terrible mess anyway, the plumber decided to remove part of the floor to look at the pipe there. In the middle of the floor, he found the problem: the dirt from the carrots was stuck in the pipe and nothing could go through or past the clump of dirt.Now I had a sink that did not drain, a refrigerator that did not work, a wall that was gone, and part of a floor that was missing. I looked at this disaster and decided that what I really needed was a new kitchen. Finally, I called a house builder to come and fix my kitchen. Three weeks later I had a new sink, a new refrigerator, new cupboards on a new wall, new tiles on a new floor, and $10,000 less in my bank. I have learned my lesson, I never wash carrots in the kitchen sink; I get them, clean and ready to eat, from the store.",

    "story": "Some students bring good luck charms to school on test days. They might keep a four-leaf clover in their pocket or wear a pair of lucky underwear. While these things can\u2019t hurt, there are better ways of doing well on a test.Writing a test is like running a marathon. Both activities require you to do your best for a long time. There are a couple of strategies you can use to stay relaxed, focused and motivated for the whole test.Runners train before a big race. They practice their skills in the same conditions they will face in the marathon. You can train for a test in a similar way. For a reading test, there may be comprehension questions on vocabulary, main idea, details, cause and effect, sequence and inferences. You may also be asked to summarize the text. For a writing test, you will likely be asked to write a paragraph about a given topic. The topics will often involve describing something, explaining how to do something, telling a story about something, or giving your opinion about something. The goal of a test is usually to independently apply the skills you have learned and practiced in class.Just like before a big race, it is a good idea to take care of your basic needs before the test begins. For example, get plenty of sleep the night before. During the day of the test, get enough to eat. Go to the bathroom ahead of time. These things will help you focus.When you get the test, don\u2019t forget to put your name on it. Then, take a quick look at each page. A long test may have different sections. Notice how many marks each section is worth. Like a runner, you will want to be careful about your pace. If you have a limited amount of time to complete the test, you will want to leave yourself enough time for the sections that are worth the most marks.Now you are ready to begin answering the questions. Read the instructions and questions very carefully. Make sure you understand what you are being asked to do. If you do not understand a question, ask your instructor. If you feel nervous, you may want to build your confidence by starting with the questions that are easiest for you.Some runners use positive self-talk when they are struggling. They tell themselves things like, \u201cI feel good about myself and my abilities. I am not going to worry. I will do the best that I can.\u201d Give this strategy a try. You can also take short brain breaks between sections to take some deep breaths, roll your neck and shoulders, and massage your temples.During a reading test, it can help to do a quick pre-reading exercise you have been taught, even if it is not part of the instructions. For example, try scanning the text to figure out the topic before you read the whole thing more carefully. Then think about what you already know about the topic. Predict the details that might be in the reading. For a writing test, pre-writing is a very important first step. Brainstorm your ideas and organize them before you start writing. Some students skip these two things, but they probably shouldn\u2019t. These activities warm up your brain so that it will work more efficiently.Before you hand in your test, review your answers. Unlike a marathon, it doesn\u2019t matter who finishes first during a test. Check your grammar and spelling. Make sure your instructor will be able to read your handwriting. Finally, be sure that you answered every question.Follow these tips and, if your lucky underwear doesn\u2019t work, you will have a solid back-up plan in place.",

    "story": "Many different factors affect how well we learn. While we can\u2019t control all of these factors, there are many that we can. For example, fuel for our brain comes from calories in the food we eat. In fact, 20% of the calories we eat are used by our brain. Although not all calories help the brain, research suggests that some foods, such as egg yolk, whole grains, nuts, fish, dark leafy green vegetables, beans, strawberries and blueberries might be especially good for concentration and memory.Drinking enough water is also important. The brain is more than 70% water. If we don\u2019t drink enough water, it affects our concentration. We need around six to eight glasses of non-sugary, non-alcoholic fluid each day. Moreover, studies suggest that the brain does not do well with sudden rushes of sugar, so sweet, fizzy drinks do not help the brain either.Remember also the importance of oxygen, which is carried to the brain by your blood. When you move your body, your blood flow increases and your brain gets more oxygen. Going for a walk, running, or riding a bike really help get oxygen to the brain, as do stretching and breathing deeply.Besides exercise, rest is important. Getting enough rest boosts our mood and helps us concentrate. What\u2019s more, when we are asleep, the brain practices what we did during the day. We actually learn in our sleep. If you have a hard time falling asleep, try listening to gentle music, thinking positive thoughts, or reading something funny to relax. Avoid video games and exciting TV shows in the hour before bedtime.Stress can also stop the brain from working at its best. Some people fight stress by imagining a beautiful box. When it\u2019s time to concentrate on something, they imagine filling that box with all the things that give them stress. Then they imagine putting that box away until they have time to deal with whatever is inside.Don\u2019t forget that your brain gets information from your senses. Therefore, your brain will have an easier time focusing and remembering when vision, hearing, smell, touch and taste are involved. Use your vision to help you learn by imagining what you read \u2013 like a movie in your mind. This is called visualizing. Underline or highlight important information in a text with a yellow marker and use different colours when you take notes. Make charts, mind maps, flashcards, diagrams, or draw pictures. Use your hearing to help you learn by reading out loud or explaining the new information to someone else. Use your sense of taste by chewing gum while you learn.Yet another way to boost your brainpower is to create an environment where you work well. Many people, for instance, work better in light from a window. Temperature can also make a difference. A room that is too warm might make you feel sleepy. Lots of people find it easier to concentrate in rooms that are tidy. Some people find it helpful to listen to music when they study while others prefer silence. Get rid of any distractions, whatever they may be. For example, turn off your cell phone and let people in your home know that you need to be left alone.",

Raven, who was always hungry, didn\u2019t like the darkness because it was difficult to find food. One day he was looking for food near the old magician\u2019s house. He heard a voice saying, \u201cI have a box, and inside this box is another box, and inside this there is another box, and inside the smallest box is all the light in the world.\u201d Raven decided to steal the light.Raven waited until the old man\u2019s daughter went down to the river to collect water.

When the girl drank some water, she swallowed Raven too.Inside the girl\u2019s belly Raven took the form of a human baby. He grew and grew, and in time she gave birth to a funny looking child with black eyes and a big nose. The old man loved his grandson so much that he gave in to the child\u2019s every wish. Raven became spoilt and greedy. He was bored with all his toys, and wanted to play with the box that held the light. Finally the grandfather opened the box and tossed the glowing ball of light to Raven.As soon as Raven caught the light, he immediately changed into his bird form. Holding the light in his beak, he flew up the chimney hole into the dark world. The magician was angry. He wanted to get the light back into his box. He flew after Raven.The light was heavy in Raven's beak, and he was getting tired. The magician was coming closer. Raven broke off some pieces of the light and threw them into the sky. They became the stars. The magician was still coming closer, so Raven broke off another piece of the light and threw it into the sky. It became the moon. Finally Raven became so tired that he tossed the last and biggest piece of the light into the sky. It became the sun; and that is how daylight came to the world.* hemlock needle: the needle-shaped leaf of an evergreen tree",

    "story": "Brendan's best friend is Tip. Tip and Brendan are inseparable. They teach each other things and they look after each other. Tip has helped Brendan become more responsible, more caring, and a better friend. Brendan is a nine-year-old boy, and Tip is a ten-year-old dog. Brendan and Tip are an example of how owning a dog can have a positive effect on a child's development. Having a dog develops a child's sense of responsibility, broadens his capacity for empathy, and teaches the nature of friendship.Having a dog helps a child learn how to act responsibly. As a dog owner, the child must take care of the animal's daily needs. The dog must be fed and exercised every day. A dog is completely dependent on its owner for all its needs, including the need for good health and a safe environment. Therefore, being responsible for a dog also means taking care of the dog so that it stays healthy. Furthermore, the owner must take responsibility for the safety of the dog and the safety of the people it comes into contact with. If the child forgets any of these duties and responsibilities, or ignores any of the dog's needs, the dog will suffer. This teaches the child that his responsibility to the dog is more important than his desire to play with his toys, talk on the phone, or watch TV. This is true not only for the care of a dog, but also for the care of oneself, another person, or one's job. Learning how to take responsibility for the health and welfare of a dog leads to learning how to take responsibility for oneself.Another lesson that a child can learn from having a dog is how to be empathetic. Empathy is the ability to put oneself in another person's, or in this case another creature's, situation and imagine that person's or creature's feelings or problems. A dog cannot express itself with speech, so its owner must learn how to interpret its behaviour. The child must learn to understand what the dog's behaviour means. Is the dog frightened, aggressive, or sick? The child needs to understand what is going on in the dog's mind. Understanding a situation from the dog's perspective helps the child understand why the dog is behaving in a certain way and what the dog needs. The result of learning to read a dog's behaviour is that the child develops empathy. By learning how to empathize with a dog, the child also learns how to empathize with other people. This leads to the child becoming a more considerate and caring person.Being considerate and caring are important characteristics in a good friend. One of the most significant benefits of owning a dog is the example of true friendship that a dog provides. A dog gives unconditional love to its owner. A dog will not stop loving its owner because of a little anger, indifference, or neglect. The dog will wait patiently for its owner to pat its head and say a few kind words. This acceptance of the negative qualities and appreciation for the positive qualities of its owner provide a wonderful model of how to be a good friend. A child soon realizes that his dog will always listen to him, will always be ready to play with him, will always protect him, and will always forgive him. A child who has learned to be even half as good a friend to others as his dog is to him will have learned one of the most valuable lessons in life.These are some of the most important lessons a child will ever learn. The benefits of owning a dog will last the child's entire lifetime. The understanding and appreciation of responsibility, empathy, and friendship that a child develops from the experience of having a dog will help him or her grow into a reliable, caring, and mature adult.",

So people just grew tomatoes because they looked nice.Now people from all over the world eat tomatoes. Tomatoes are used in sauce, soup, juice, salsa, and ketchup. The tomato is very good for you. Only a tomato leaf or stem will make you sick.People do odd things with tomatoes. People grow tomatoes in space. There is a big tomato fight every year in Spain. A long time ago, people would toss a bad tomato when they saw a show they did not like.In Canada, many tomatoes are grown on big farms. The farms bring in poorpeople from far away to help grow tomatoes. Without these workers, the farms could not run. But the workers do not get much money. Canada does not let the workers stay here. Many people say this is not fair.Most farms pick tomatoes before they are ripe. They last longer this way. But these tomatoes do not taste as good. So lots of people grow their own tomatoes.Tomatoes that you grow are better than tomatoes that you buy. You can grow tomatoes inside if you do not have a garden.You need: Tomato seedsA big pot (50 cm deep)Potting soil (many big food shops sell this)A windowFill the pot with potting soil. Pack the soil down a little bit. Put a seed on top of the soil. Add a bit more soil on top.Add water. The soil must always be a bit wet. Seeds like to be warm. Put your pot in a warm place. It does not need sun yet.The plant will grow above the soil. Put the plant by a window. The plant needs four hours of sun a day. You can tie the stem to a stick to help the plant stay up.

    "story": "As Andrea turned off the motorway onto the road to Brockbourne, the small village in which she lived, it was four o'clock in the afternoon, but already the sun was falling behind the hills. At this time in December, it would be completely dark by five o'clock. Andrea shivered. The interior of the car was not cold, but the trees bending in the harsh wind and the patches of yesterday's snow still heaped in the fields made her feel chilly inside. It was another ten miles to the cottage where she lived with her husband Michael, and the dim light and wintry weather made her feel a little lonely. She would have liked to listen to the radio, but it had been stolen from her car when it was parked outside her office in London about two weeks ago, and she had not got around to replacing it yet.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was just coming out of the little village of Mickley when she saw the old lady, standing by the road, with a crude hand-written sign saying \"Brockbourne\" in her hand. Andrea was surprised. She had never seen an old lady hitchhiking before. However, the weather and the coming darkness made her feel sorry for the lady, waiting hopefully on a country road like this with little traffic. Normally, Andrea would never pick up a hitchhiker when she was alone, thinking it was too dangerous, but what was the harm in doing a favor for a little old lady like this? Andrea pulled up a little way down the road, and the lady, holding a big shopping bag, hurried over to climb in the door which Andrea had opened for her.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When she did get in, Andrea could see that she was not, in fact, so little. Broad and fat, the old lady had some difficulty climbing in through the car door, with her big bag, and when she had got in, she more than filled the seat next to Andrea. She wore a long, shabby old dress, and she had a yellow hat pulled down low over her eyes. Panting noisily from her effort, she pushed her big brown canvas shopping bag down onto the floor under her feet, and said in a voice which was almost a whisper, \"Thank you dearie -- I'm just going to Brockbourne.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you live there?\" asked Andrea, thinking that she had never seen the old lady in the village in the four years she had lived there herself.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, dearie,\" answered the passenger, in her soft voice, \"I'm just going to visit a friend. He was supposed to meet me back there at Mickley, but his car won't start, so I decided to hitchhike -- there isn't a bus until seven, and I didn't want to wait. I knew some kind soul would give me a lift.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something in the way the lady spoke, and the way she never turned her head, but stared continuously into the darkness ahead from under her old yellow hat, made Andrea uneasy about this strange hitchhiker. She didn't know why, but she felt instinctively that there was something wrong, something odd, something....dangerous. But how could an old lady be dangerous? it was absurd.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Careful not to turn her head, Andrea looked sideways at her passenger. She studied the hat, the dirty collar of the dress, the shapeless body, the arms with their thick black hairs....\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thick black hairs?\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hairy arms? Andrea's blood froze.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This wasn't a woman. It was a man.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At first, she didn't know what to do. Then suddenly, an idea came into her racing, terrified brain. Swinging the wheel suddenly, she threw the car into a skid, and brought it to a halt.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My God!\" she shouted, \"A child! Did you see the child? I think I hit her!\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \"old lady\" was clearly shaken by the sudden skid. \"I didn't see anything dearie,\" she said. \"I don't think you hit anything.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sure it was a child!\" insisted Andrea. \"Could you just get out and have a look? Just see if there's anything on the road?\" She held her breath. Would her plan work?\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It did. The passenger slowly opened the car door, leaving her bag inside, and climbed out to investigate. As soon as she was out of the vehicle, Andrea gunned the engine and accelerated madly away. The car door swung shut as she rounded a bend, and soon she had put a good three miles between herself and the awful hitchhiker.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was only then that she thought about the bag lying on the floor in front of her. Maybe the bag would provide some information about the real identity about the old woman who was not an old woman. Pulling into the side of the road, Andrea lifted the heavy bag onto her lap and opened it curiously.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It contained only one item -- a small hand axe, with a razor-sharp blade. The axe, and the inside of the bag, were covered with the dark red stains of dried blood.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Andrea began to scream.\n\n \n\nMDH 1994 -- From a common urban legend",

    "story": "Dave Farrow is a Canadian who appears in the Guinness Book of World Records for having the greatest memory. As a student, Dave had a learning disability called dyslexia. Despite his struggles with subjects like reading and writing, Dave found ways to improve his memory in order to do well in school. In 2008, he set a world record by memorizing the order of 59 decks of playing cards in two days. How did his brain store all of this information? According to Dave, anybody\u2019s brain can do it, but it helps to understand how memory works.Your brain is constantly taking in information through your senses. The information enters your sensory memory, which has the capacity to hold lots of information, but only for a few seconds. If you ignore the information, your brain will discard it. However, if you pay attention to it, the information goes into your short term- memory. This is why learning to pay attention is an important first step to improving your ability to recall what you learn.To help the brain focus, Dave recommends breaking big tasks down into smeller ones. He sets a timer and works as hard as he can for short periods of time until the timer alarm sounds. Then he takes a small break. This keeps his focus strong.Your short-term memory can only hold information from 15 seconds to a few minutes. In addition, short-term memory can only hold about seven things at one time. Memory champions like Dave have to hold long lists of information in their short-term memory at one time. To do this, they rely on different tricks.One trick is to look at the first letter of every word you want to memorize. Then, create your own word, phrase or sentence using all of those letters. This is called an acronym. For example, if you want to remember all the colours in a rainbow, try remembering the name Roy G. Biv. Each letter in this fictional name matches the first letter of a colour: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. When you want to remember the colours of a rainbow, just think of Roy G. Biv and you will have an easier time.Another trick is to organize information into chunks. For example, when you try to remember a telephone number, your brain usually remembers it in chunks. You remember the area code as one chunk, the next three numbers as a chunk, and the last four numbers as a chunk. This way, your brain only has to remember three things instead of ten. This works for words as well as numbers. Imagine that you wish to improve your vocabulary. Whenever you learn a new word, study words that share the same meaning. This way, you learn several new words at the same time and you only need to memorize one definition. Such words are called synonyms. For example, synonyms for the word big are huge, enormous, gigantic, large and massive.A third memory trick is to use visualization. Say you wanted to memorize how people how people developed from wormlike creatures into human beings. First, create a picture in your mind for each stage (picture a worm, a fish, a monkey and a human). Then think of a path you regularly walk along. For example, you might normally walk from the path outside your home, into your house and into the kitchen. Finally, imagine each picture in a place along that path. For instance, in the garden you might see a worm. There might be a garbage can in the garden. You can imagine that the garbage can is full of rainwater and inside you can see a fish. When you enter the house you might see a bedroom door. You can imagine a monkey is jumping on the bed. Then you might see a member of your family, a human, cooking dinner. Visualize that path a few times and you\u2019ll have the information memorized. Visualization works because the brain remembers images well, and the wackier an image is, the easier it is to remember.If you don\u2019t keep using the information, your brain throws it away. If you keep reviewing the information, it will go into your long-term memory. The more you practice recalling the information, the better you will be at remembering it. Try these tips the next time you need to remember a phone number, a new word or something for school.",

He was walking along the beach in Haida Gwaii, looking for some new way to amuse himself. As he walked along the beach, the blue ocean in front of him and the green forest behind him didn\u2019t seem interesting. Raven wanted to play, but there was no one to play with.Then he heard a strange sound, unlike any sound he knew. He looked up and down the beach. Where was it coming from? As he walked he noticed a large white clamshell lying in the sand. Inside the clamshell were tiny creatures, unlike any he had seen before.Raven bent down to get a closer look. The creatures seemed afraid of him, so he began to coax them in a gentle voice, \u201cCome out. Come out. Don\u2019t be afraid. I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201dA few of the creatures came out of the clamshell. They were very different from Raven. They had no feathers, no wings, and no beaks. Like him, they walked on two legs, but they had arms, faces with mouths, and black hair. They spoke to each other in a language that Raven didn\u2019t understand. These tiny creatures were the first humans.Raven enjoyed watching these humans play and explore the world. After a while, when he was beginning to feel bored again, he noticed that these humans were only men. There were no women. Raven had an idea. He wondered if he could find some women. He searched for a long time. Then he saw some * chitons . He opened one of the chitons and found some lovely, tiny women. He brought the women to the men.Raven enjoyed watching the behaviour of the men and women. He saw them begin to pair off and have children. The human families moved to other parts of the island. Since that day, many generations of humans have grown and flourished, and Raven has never been bored.* Chiton: a large sea shell",

    "story": "It was a cold night in September. The rain was drumming on the car roof as George and Marie Winston drove through the empty country roads towards the house of their friends, the Harrisons, where they were going to attend a party to celebrate the engagement of the Harrisons' daughter, Lisa. As they drove, they listened to the local radio station, which was playing classical music.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They were about five miles from their destination when the music on the radio was interrupted by a news announcement:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The Cheshire police have issued a serious warning after a man escaped from Colford Mental Hospital earlier this evening. The man, John Downey, is a murderer who killed six people before he was captured two years ago. He is described as large, very strong and extremely dangerous. People in the Cheshire area are warned to keep their doors and windows locked, and to call the police immediately if they see anyone acting strangely.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marie shivered. \"A crazy killer. And he's out there somewhere. That's scary.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't worry about it,\" said her husband. \"We're nearly there now. Anyway, we have more important things to worry about. This car is losing power for some reason -- it must be that old problem with the carburetor. If it gets any worse, we'll have to stay at the Harrisons' tonight and get it fixed before we travel back tomorrow.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As he spoke, the car began to slow down. George pressed the accelerator, but the engine only coughed. Finally they rolled to a halt, as the engine died completely. Just as they stopped, George pulled the car off the road, and it came to rest under a large tree.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Blast!\" said George angrily. \"Now we'll have to walk in the rain.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But that'll take us an hour at least,\" said Marie. \"And I have my high-heeled shoes and my nice clothes on. They'll be ruined!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, you'll have to wait while I run to the nearest house and call the Harrisons. Someone can come out and pick us up,\" said George.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But George! Have you forgotten what the radio said? There's a homicidal maniac out there! You can't leave me alone here!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You'll have to hide in the back of the car. Lock all the doors and lie on the floor in the back, under this blanket. No-one will see you. When I come back, I'll knock three times on the door. Then you can get up and open it. Don't open it unless you hear three knocks.\" George opened the door and slipped out into the rain. He quickly disappeared into the blackness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marie quickly locked the doors and settled down under the blanket in the back for a long wait. She was frightened and worried, but she was a strong-minded woman. She had not been waiting long, however, when she heard a strange scratching noise. It seemed to be coming from the roof of the car.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marie was terrified. She listened, holding her breath. Then she heard three slow knocks, one after the other, also on the roof of the car. Was it her husband? Should she open the door? Then she heard another knock, and another. This was not her husband. It was somebody -- or something -- else. She was shaking with fear, but she forced herself to lie still. The knocking continued -- bump, bump, bump, bump.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many hours later, as the sun rose, she was still lying there. She had not slept for a moment. The knocking had never stopped, all night long. She did not know what to do. Where was George? Why had he not come for her?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, she heard the sound of three or four vehicles, racing quickly down the road. All of them pulled up around her, their tires screeching on the road. At last! Someone had come! Marie sat up quickly and looked out of the window.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The three vehicles were all police cars, and two still had their lights flashing. Several policemen leapt out. One of them rushed towards the car as Marie opened the door. He took her by the hand.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Get out of the car and walk with me to the police vehicle. miss. You're safe now. Look straight ahead. Keep looking at the police car. Don't look back. Just don't look back.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something in the way he spoke filled Marie with cold horror. She could not help herself. About ten yards from the police car, she stopped, turned and looked back at the empty vehicle.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0George was hanging from the tree above the car, a rope tied around his neck. As the wind blew his body back and forth, his feet were bumping gently on the roof of the car -- bump, bump, bump, bump.\n\n\n\n(MDH 1994 -- From a common urban legend)",

    "story": "\"Mummy! Mummy!\" shouted little Murna racing from the front door through to the kitchen. \"There's a parcel. The postman's brought a parcel!\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Her mother, Savni, looked at her in surprise. She had no idea who could have sent them a parcel. Maybe it was a mistake. She hurried to the door to find out. Sure enough, the postman was there, holding a parcel about the size of a\n\n small brick.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"From America, madam,\" he said. \"See! American stamps.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was true. In the top right-hand corner of the brown paper parcel were three strange-looking stamps, showing a man's head. The package was addressed to Savni, in big, clear black letters.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Well, I suppose it must be from Great-Aunt Pasni,\" said Savni to herself, as the postman went on his way down the street, whistling. \"Although it must be twenty years since we heard anything from her. I thought she would have been dead by now.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Savni's husband Jornas and her son Arinas were just coming in from the garden, where Murna had run to tell them about the parcel. \"Well, open it then!\" said Arinas impatiently. \"Let's see what's inside!\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Setting the parcel down in the middle of the table, Savni carefully began to tear open the paper. Inside, there was a large silver container with a hinged lid, which was taped shut. There was also a letter.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"What is it? What is it?\" demanded Murna impatiently. \"Is it a present?\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"I have no idea,\" said Savni in confusion. \"I think it must be from Great-Aunt Pasni. She went to America almost thirty years ago now. But we haven't heard from her in twenty years. Perhaps the letter will tell us.\" She opened the folded page cautiously, then looked up in dismay. \"Well, this is no help!\" she said in annoyance. \"It's written in English! How does she expect us to read English? We're poor people, we have no education. Maybe Pasni has forgotten her native language, after thirty years in America.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Well, open the pot, anyway,\" said Jornas. \"Let's see what's inside.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cautiously, Savni pulled the tape from the neck of the silver pot, and opened the lid. Four heads touched over the top of the container, as their owners stared down inside.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Strange,\" said Arinas. \"All I see is powder.\" The pot was about one-third full of a kind of light-grey powder.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"What is it?\" asked Murna, mystified.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"We don't know, darling,\" said Savni, stroking her daughter's hair. \"What do you think?\" Murna stared again into the pot.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"I think it's coffee,\" she announced, finally. \"American\n\n coffee.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"It's the wrong colour for coffee, darling,\" said Jornas thoughtfully. \"But maybe she's on the right track. It must be some kind of food.\" Murna, by now, had her nose right down into the pot. Suddenly, she lifted her head and sneezed loudly.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Id god ub by doze,\" she explained.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"That's it!\" said Arinas. \"It must be pepper! Let me try some.\" Dipping a finger into the powder, he licked it. \"Yes,\" he said, \"it's pepper all right. Mild, but quite tasty. It's American pepper.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"All right,\" said Savni, \"we'll try it on the stew tonight. We'll\n\n have American-style stew!\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That evening, the whole family agreed that the American pepper had added a special extra taste to their usual evening stew. They were delighted with it. By the end of the week, there was only a teaspoonful of the grey powder\n\n left in the silver container. Then Savni called a halt.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"We're saving the last bit for Sunday. Dr. Haret is coming to dinner, and we'll let him have some as a special treat. Then it will be finished.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The following Sunday, the whole family put on their best clothes, ready for dinner with Dr. Haret. He was the local doctor, and he had become a friend of the family many years before, when he had saved Arinas's life after an accident. Once every couple of months, Savni invited the doctor for dinner, and they all looked forward to his entertaining stories of his youth at the university in the\n\n capital.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During dinner, Savni explained to the doctor about the mysterious American pepper, the last of which she had put in the stew they were eating, and the letter they could not read.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Well, give it to me, give it to me!\" said the doctor briskly. \"I speak English! I can translate it for you.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Savni brought the letter, and the family waited, fascinated, as the doctor began to translate.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Dear Savni: you don't know me, but I am the son of your old Great-Aunt Pasni. She never talked much to us about the old country, but in her final illness earlier this year, she told us that after her death, she wanted her ashes to be sent back home to you, so that you could scatter them on the hills of the country where she was born. My mother died two weeks ago, and her funeral and cremation took place last week. I am sending her ashes to you in a silver casket. Please do as she asked, and spread them over the ground near where she was born. Your cousin, George Leary.\"\n\n \n\nMDH 1995 -- from a common urban legend",

Many hunters wanted to marry her, but she refused their offers. Her father scolded her, saying, \u201cI am getting older, and soon you will need a good husband who can provide you with food and furs. You must marry the next hunter who asks for you.\u201d Sedna still wasn\u2019t interested.Soon a young hunter from a distant place came to her father\u2019s camp . He was dressed in warm furs, and spoke in a soft voice. He promised to provide a good home and plenty of animals for food and clothing. Although he kept his face hidden under his hood, Sedna was very impressed with him, so she agreed to marry him.Sedna got into her husband\u2019s kayak and travelled with him to her new home. When they arrived at his island, she saw that her home was nothing but some sticks and bits of moss and feathers clinging to a large rock. Her husband took off his hood, and she realized that he was not a man, but an evil raven. He never hunted, he only caught fish. Sedna was cold, lonely, hungry, and very unhappy. Every day she cried for her father to come and save her.Her father heard her cries and decided to rescue her. He paddled his kayak to the island where she was living. On their way home, Sedna looked back and saw that the raven was following them. He was gaining on them quickly. As the raven came close, her father took his paddle and struck the bird, who had to fall back. Then the raven flapped his powerful wings at the ocean and caused a huge storm to blow up.When her father saw that their lives were in danger, he became afraid for his own life. He threw Sedna over the side of the kayak. Sedna tried to save herself. She grabbed onto the kayak with her fingers, but her father took his paddle and beat at her fingers until they broke off. As they sank into the ocean, her fingers turned into seals and fish. Again, Sedna grabbed the kayak with her hands, but her father took his paddle and beat her hands until they also fell into the water.

    "story": "Floods are second only to fire as the most common of all natural disasters. They occur almost everywhere in the world, resulting in widespread damage and even death. Consequently, scientists have long tried to perfect their ability to predict floods. So far, the best that scientists can do is to recognize the potential for flooding in certain conditions. There are a number of conditions, from deep snow on the ground to human error, that cause flooding.When deep snow melts it creates a large amount of water. Although deep snow alone rarely causes floods, when it occurs together with heavy rain and sudden warmer weather it can lead to serious flooding. If there is a fast snow melt on top of frozen or very wet ground, flooding is more likely to occur than when the ground is not frozen. Frozen ground or ground that is very wet and already saturated with water cannot absorb the additional water created by the melting snow. Melting snow also contributes to high water levels in rivers and streams. Whenever rivers are already at their full capacity of water, heavy rains will result in the rivers overflowing and flooding the surrounding land.Rivers that are covered in ice can also lead to flooding. When ice begins to melt, the surface of the ice cracks and breaks into large pieces. These pieces of ice move and float down the river. They can form a dam in the river, causing the water behind the dam to rise and flood the land upstream. If the dam breaks suddenly, then the large amount of water held behind the dam can flood the areas downstream too.Broken ice dams are not the only dam problems that can cause flooding. When a large human-made dam breaks or fails to hold the water collected behind it, the results can be devastating. Dams contain such huge amounts of water behind them that when sudden breaks occur, the destructive force of the water is like a great tidal wave. Unleashed dam waters can travel tens of kilometres, cover the ground in metres of mud and debris, and drown and crush every thing and creature in their path.Although scientists cannot always predict exactly when floods will occur, they do know a great deal about when floods are likely, or probably, going to occur. Deep snow, ice-covered rivers, and weak dams are all strong conditions for potential flooding. Hopefully, this knowledge of why floods happen can help us reduce the damage they cause.",

He had no family, so he made his living by doing odd jobs for other people in his village, such as cutting wood and tending cattle. His life was difficult, but Liang was a generous boy and always willing to help people who needed it. In his heart he had a dream. He wanted to paint pictures and become a great artist. He practised drawing all the time. When he was in the forest cutting wood, he drew birds and animals with a stick. If he was looking after a farmers\u2019 cows he drew on the sides of the barn. Whatever he was doing he drew \u2013 plants, animals, birds and people. He thought of nothing else except drawing, and soon he became very good at it.One night Liang dreamed that an old man gave him a paintbrush. The man said it was a magic paintbrush and Liang should use it to help people. When Liang woke up the next morning, he was surprised to see that he had a beautiful paintbrush in his hand. Liang was hungry, so he painted a bowl of rice. Suddenly the rice became real, and he ate it. Now he felt happy, so he drew a bird. The bird came to life and flew away.When Liang went into the village he met an old farmer carrying water from the river to his field. It was a long walk and the man was very tired. Liang painted a river beside the field and the river came to life. Now the farmer could easily bring the water to his crops. Soon Liang met another villager who was crying because his cow had died in the night, and there was no milk for his children. Liang drew a cow, and it came to life. The villager was overjoyed and happily began to milk his cow.From that day Liang used his paintbrush to help the people in his village. Whenever they needed something, Liang would paint it. Soon the villagers began to prosper, and word of Liang\u2019s magic paintbrush began to travel beyond the village.People asked him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you use your magic paintbrush to become rich?\u201d\u201cWhat else do I need?\u201d replied Liang. \u201cI feel rich because I can help.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long before a rich man who lived near the village heard about Liang\u2019s magic paintbrush, and thought he would use it to make himself richer than the emperor. This man decided to steal Liang\u2019s paintbrush. He sent some of his * thugs to Liang\u2019s home, where they captured Liang and put him in prison. The rich man took the paintbrush.The rich man wanted to show off his power so he invited some friends to his house. He drew a lot of pictures, but not one picture became real. The rich man figured there must be some special secret that he didn\u2019t know about, so he sent for Liang. When Liang stood before him he said, \u201cIf you draw some pictures for me and they become real, I will let you go free.\u201dLiang knew that this rich man was not a good man. He didn\u2019t want to help, but he wanted to be free. He had an idea. He said, \u201cI will help you, but you must let me go.\u201d\u201cPaint me a golden mountain,\u201d said the rich man. \u201cI want to go there and get lots of gold.\u201d What he didn\u2019t say out loud was, \u201cAnd then I will be the richest man in the kingdom, richer even than the emperor himself!\u201dLiang drew a picture of the sea.\u201cWhy did you draw the sea?\u201d said the rich man, \u201cI told you to draw the mountain. I want gold, not fish!\u201d\u201cThe mountain is on the other side of the sea.\u201d replied Liang. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d Liang drew the golden mountain on the other side of the sea.When the rich man saw the mountain shining in gold his eyes lit up like two yellow suns. \u201cYes!\u201d he said, \u201cThat\u2019s much better! But the mountain is far from here. How will I get there?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll draw you a boat to get to the mountain,\u201d said Liang. And he drew a golden dragon boat that was even bigger and more beautiful than the emperor\u2019s boat. The rich man climbed aboard the boat and stood in the bow facing the golden mountain. He said to Liang,\u201d Now draw me a wind to take the boat to the mountain.\u201d Liang began to draw a wind, and the boat set sail. The rich man stretched his arms out to grab the golden mountain. \u201cMake the wind stronger so I can get there faster,\u201d he said to Liang. Liang kept drawing and the wind got stronger. Soon the wind became a terrible gale and the rich man\u2019s beautiful boat sank beneath the sea and took him down with it.People say that Liang married a beautiful girl from his village and had a big family, and they were happy all their days.* thug: a violent and rough person",

    "story": "\"Come on, come on, move it, idiot!\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joanne beat impatiently on the steering wheel of her Mercedes sports car. How stupid to get caught up in the rush hour! She had planned to leave work early this afternoon, at three o'clock, to give herself a chance to relax and have a bath before going out to a meeting of her local tennis club. But just at ten to three a client had arrived, and it was two hours before she had finished dealing with the man. When she came out of her office, all the other staff in the Highlight Advertising Agency had already left. Now she was stuck in a traffic jam in central Birmingham at 5:30, and at 6:30 she was expected to be chairing a meeting of the tennis club. There would be no time for any hot bath.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ahead of her, the traffic was moving at last, and she swung quickly out into the centre lane to turn right, and raced the last half-mile through the quiet suburban streets to her house. Pulling up on the driveway, she leapt out of the car and ran for the house. As she opened the door, she nearly tripped over Sheba, who was standing behind it.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hey, Sheba, hello,\" she said, bending down to stroke the large alsatian dog's head, \"I've got no time for you now, but I'll take you out as soon as I get back from the tennis club.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was then that she noticed something worrying about the dog. Sheba seemed to be coughing or choking, her stomach pumping repeatedly as if she was trying to vomit something up. She was obviously in real discomfort and could hardly breathe; her sad eyes gazed up at Joanne helplessly.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh damn, this is all I need now,\" said Joanne to herself, dropping her briefcase and bending down to take a closer look, \"a sick dog, today of all days!\" On closer examination, Sheba did look very sick, and Joanne realised she would have to take her down to the vet immediately. Luckily, the vet's surgery was only a few streets away, and Joanne quickly loaded the dog, still coughing and choking, into her car for the short drive.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When she got there, the surgery was just about to close for the day. Luckily, Dr. Sterne had not left yet, and when he saw the state of Sheba, he brought her quickly into his office.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It looks like something is stuck in her throat,\" said Dr. Sterne. It shouldn't take me too long to get it out.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Listen, doctor, I'm really in a rush to get to a meeting -- can I leave her with you, and go and get changed? I'll be back in ten minutes to pick her up, then I'll take her on to the meeting with me. Is that OK?\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sure,\" said the doctor. \"You get going. I'll see you in ten minutes.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joanne jumped back into her car again, and made the quick trip round to her house in a couple of minutes. As she was once more entering the hallway, the phone on the table by the door began to ring. She picked it up, annoyed by this additional interruption to her plans.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This is Dr. Sterne,\" said an anxious voice. \"Is that you, Joanne?\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Of course it's me,\" said Joanne, surprised at the sound of his voice, \"no-one else lives here.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"I want you to get right out of that house immediately,\" said the doctor's voice. \"Right now. I'm coming round right away, and the police will be there any time now. Wait outside for us.\" The phone went dead. Joanne stared at it. She was confused, but she was also a little frightened by the obvious fear in the voice of the doctor. She replaced the receiver, then quickly backed out of the door and ran into the street.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment, a police car with its lights flashing swung round the corner and screeched to a stop outside the house. Two policemen got out. After briefly checking that she was the owner of the house, they ran into the house through the still open door, without explaining anything. Joanne was by now completely confused and very frightened. Then the doctor arrived.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Where's Sheba? Is she OK?\" shouted Joanne, running over to his car.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She's fine, Joanne. I extracted the thing which was choking her, and she's OK now.\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well what's this all about? Why are the police in my house?\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just then, the two policemen reappeared from the house, half-carrying a white-faced figure, a man in a dark grey sweater and jeans, who, it seemed, could hardly walk. There was blood all over him.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My God,\" said Joanne, \"how did he get in there? And how did you know he was there?\"\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think he must be a burglar,\" said the doctor. \"I knew he was there because when I finally removed what was stuck in Sheba's throat, it turned out to be three human fingers. I don't think he's a very happy burglar.\"\n\n \n\nMDH 1994 -- From a common urban legend",

    "story": "There is a famous expression in English: \"Stop the world, I want to get off!\" This expression refers to a feeling of panic, or stress, that makes a person want to stop whatever they are doing, try to relax, and become calm again. 'Stress' means pressure or tension. It is one of the most common causes of health problems in modern life. Too much stress results in physical, emotional, and mental health problems.There are numerous physical effects of stress. Stress can affect the heart. It can increase the pulse rate, make the heart miss beats, and can cause high blood pressure. Stress can affect the respiratory system. It can lead to asthma. It can cause a person to breathe too fast, resulting in a loss of important carbon dioxide. Stress can affect the stomach. It can cause stomach aches and problems digesting food. These are only a few examples of the wide range of illnesses and symptoms resulting from stress.Emotions are also easily affected by stress. People suffering from stress often feel anxious. They may have panic attacks. They may feel tired all the time. When people are under stress, they often overreact to little problems. For example, a normally gentle parent under a lot of stress at work may yell at a child for dropping a glass of juice. Stress can make people angry, moody, or nervous.Long-term stress can lead to a variety of serious mental illnesses. Depression, an extreme feeling of sadness and hopelessness, can be the result of continued and increasing stress. Alcoholism and other addictions often develop as a result of overuse of alcohol or drugs to try to relieve stress. Eating disorders, such as anorexia, are sometimes caused by stress and are often made worse by stress. If stress is allowed to continue, then one's mental health is put at risk.It is obvious that stress is a serious problem. It attacks the body. It affects the emotions. Untreated, it may eventually result in mental illness. Stress has a great influence on the health and well-being of our bodies, our feelings, and our minds. So, reduce stress: stop the world and rest for a while.",

    "story": "The human brain remembers negative experiences more easily than positive ones. Our brains have developed this way because threats, like dangerous animals, had a more immediate effect on our ancestors\u2019 survival compared to positive things like food or shelter. As a result, you likely know what makes you unhappy, but do you know what makes you happy?Research suggests that our level of happiness depends partly on factors we cannot control \u2013 our genes and our life circumstances. But our level of happiness is also shaped by the choices we make. If you\u2019ve been chasing wealth, fame, good looks, material things, and power, you may be looking for happiness in all the wrong places. Psychologists suggest that the following seven habits make people happier.People who form close relationships tend to be happier than those who do not. The number of friends we have is not important. What matters is the quality of our relationships. Relationships that bring happiness usually involve the sharing of feelings, mutual respect, acceptance, trust, fun and empathy.People who make a habit of caring for the wellbeing of others tend to be happier. This might involve volunteering for an organization or reaching out to support friends and family on a regular basis.People who exercise regularly improve both their physical and mental well-being. Some research has shown that exercise can be as effective as medication in treating depression.When we are so interested in an activity we enjoy that we lose track of time, we are in a state of flow. The activity could be making art, playing piano, surfing, or playing a game. People who experience flow in their work or hobbies tend to be happier.People who include spirituality in their daily life tend to be happier. Practicing spirituality is a way of recognizing and trying to understand the wonder and beauty of existence. Some people do this by going to a place of worship or praying. Some people practice yoga or meditation. Some people go for long walks in nature.People are more likely to be happy if they know what their strengths are and use them regularly. People who set goals and use their strengths to achieve them tend to be happier. People are especially happy when they can use their strengths to serve the greater good.People who think positively by being grateful, mindful, and optimistic are more likely to be happy. Being grateful means being thankful. Being mindful means being open to, focusing on, and enjoying the experiences of the present moment. Being optimistic means being hopeful about the future.",

Before he climbed on his donkey to ride home, the shopkeeper and the shop-assistant ran out.\"You didn't pay for the robe!\" said the shopkeeper.\"But I gave you the trousers in exchange for the robe, didn't I?\" replied Nasreddin.\"Yes, but you didn't pay for the trousers, either!\" said the shopkeeper.\"But I didn't buy the trousers,\" replied Nasreddin. \"I am not so stupid as to pay for something which I never bought.\"",

    "story": "Jack lay, quiet and unmoving, for thirty minutes while a stranger repeatedly stabbed him with sharp needles, causing blood to pour steadily out of his leg. Jack was getting a tattoo. His friend Tony had recently gotten a tattoo, and Jack was so impressed by Tony's bravery and his tattoo that he decided to get one too. Getting a tattoo because your friends and peers have them is just one of the reasons why a lot of young people in North America get tattoos. Peer pressure, media influence, and personal expression are some of the common reasons for wearing tattoos today.The desire to be part of a group, to be accepted by one's friends or peers, can have a great influence on what a person does. Sometimes, wearing a tattoo can be a sign that you belong to a certain group. Gangs often use special clothes and tattoos to identify their particular group. For example, in one gang all the members may wear green army jackets and have large 'Xs' tattooed on their arms. It is not only gangs that have this type of special 'uniform'. Young people often belong to a certain group of friends. Some of these groups wear only brand-name clothes. Some wear only black clothes. Others wear tattoos. When a person's friends are all doing something, such as getting a tattoo, that person is more likely to do the same thing, and get a tattoo too.The media is another big influence behind the popularity of tattoos in North America. A wide variety of media images show tattoos. Tattoos can be seen on people appearing in commercials selling expensive cars. Famous sports heroes with tattoos are shown in magazines. Fashion models are often seen in magazines and on TV wearing designer clothes that show their bodies tattooed with detailed and colourful patterns. These media images link tattoos to ideas of wealth, success, and status. As a result, many people decide to get a tattoo for its fashion and status value.It is not always the influence of other people or the media that results in a person getting a tattoo. Many people decide to wear tattoos in order to express their artistic nature, their beliefs, or their feelings -- in other words, to show their individuality. A musician in a rock band may get a tattoo of a guitar on the arm. Some environmentalists may tattoo pictures of endangered animals on their shoulders. Lovers may tattoo each others' names over their hearts. A tattoo can be a public sign to show what is important in a person's life.As you can see, there are many reasons why young North Americans get tattoos. A tattoo can be part of a group's uniform. It can be a sign of fashion. It can be an expression of individuality. The decision to get a tattoo is most often a result of the influence of friends or media or the desire to express oneself. For Jack, it was a mixture of all three.",
