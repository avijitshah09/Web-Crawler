Every August and September, the Los Angeles County Fair takes center stage at the Fairplex facility in Pomona, California. This year, the fair runs from August 29 - Sept. 28, and will feature various attractions for the entire family. Going to a county fair is as American as apple pie. It was once a main attraction for rural Americans who lived far away from big cities. The traveling fair was a huge event at that time as it only came once a year. People would wait the entire year for the fair to come to their town, and many of them participated in it.

The L.A. County Fair is one of the largest fairs in the country. It features just about every kind of farm animals around. Parents can take their children to the petting zoos, where kids can pet lambs, piglets, calves, and foals. Additionally, people can bring home pets from the fair that include such exotic animals like snakes, rodents, and even tarantulas.

Other attractions include the barnyard races that feature piglets racing around a track at breakneck speeds. There are several game booths, and a carnival that has some of the most exciting and thrilling rides in the region. This year the fair will introduce an exhibit that demonstrates how life was for early Californians, and a wilderness show. The wilderness show focuses on appreciating the natural beauty of the state, and how people today can preserve its beauty for future generations. The fair also stages several concerts on weekend nights from some of the top performers in the music industry.

Of course, the main attraction the fair has to offer is the food. Here people can enjoy food that is only offered at the fair. One favorite is the chocolate covered bacon treat. It is a place for those with hearty appetites. Almost any food that can be deep-fried can be found at the L.A. County Fair.
