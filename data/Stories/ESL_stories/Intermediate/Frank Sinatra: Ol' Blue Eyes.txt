Ol' Blue Eyes is the name given to Francis Albert "Frank" Sinatra by his adoring public during his heydays from the 1940s through 60s. Sinatra had one of the smoothest, most recognizable voices of any singer before, or since him. He was suave, and debonair, and he epitomized the "cool cate" persona popular in that era. Sinatra may have gotten his start in entertainment with his golden voice, but he was able to transition that talent into a successful film career. He also lists directing, producing, and conducting among his list of considerable talent.

Sinatra was born on December 12, 1915 in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was the son of Italian, Catholic immigrants who came to the United States in search of a better life for their children. Sinatra showed interest in music from an early age. He was greatly influenced by big band music, and got his first job singing at local bars at the age of 8. Sinatra was a rowdy young boy.

As a teenager in the 1930s, Sinatra had worked several odd jobs before he got a break performing with the Tommy Dorsey Band. This band was a major attraction, and it marked the beginning of Sinatra's entertainment career. Sinatra parted ways with Dorsey, and by 1941, he was a legitimate star on his own. His popularity grew during the next decade, but went into decline by the 1950s. It was then that Sinatra first appeared on the Silver Screen. He starred opposite Gene Kelly in the film adaptation of Anchors Aweigh. This film not only began a second career for Sinatra, it also revitalized his singing career.

Sinatra's legacy is firmly in place. He sang some of the most memorable love songs in the history of U.S. music, and his music is as popular today as it was during his era.
