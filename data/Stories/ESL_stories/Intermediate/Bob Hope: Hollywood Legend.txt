One of the most beloved Hollywood actors to grace the silver screen was the legendary actor Bob Hope. Hope was an English citizen who immigrated to the United States, calling America home for much of his life. He was a prolific actor, comedian, singer, dancer, and author who appeared in some of the most popular Hollywood films during the 40s, 50s, and 60s. During his 60-year entertainment career, Hope starred in more than 70 films, along with television, and stage appearances.

Born in London on May 29, 1903, Hope enjoyed a long and profitable career. He lived to be 100 years old, dying in 2003. He is probably best known for his United Services Organization (USO) shows, where he entertained United States troops overseas. He made nearly 60 tours in a 50-year span from 1941 through 1991.

His Hollywood legacy begins with the popular Road movies, where Hope starred alongside Bing Crosby, and Dorothy LaMour. During his early years in the United Kingdom, Hope worked in many jobs, including street performing, where he would sing and dance to earn pocket money. He worked for a time as a butcher, and linesman before settling on an entertainment career. He first starred in the U.S. as a Broadway, Vaudeville actor in New York City, and in radio. In 1934, with the advent of TV, Hope made the switch from radio to television, and was one of the first major stars on TV.

His Hollywood career is one of the most prolific of any actor in the history of the American big screen. He translated his immense popularity in film into a successful career entertaining troops overseas. This part of his entertainment career began in 1939 at the beginning of World War II, while Hope was onboard the RMS Queen Mary.
