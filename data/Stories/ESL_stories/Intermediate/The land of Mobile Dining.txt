There are many traditional restaurants in the Los Angeles area that offer first-rate dining experiences, but one of the recent trends moving through the city is mobile food trucks. Mobile food trucks, or catering trucks, were formerly seen mostly at places of business. Some businesses that had a large number of employees contracted with these trucks to bring food to the company's site to provide breakfast and lunch. It was an alternative choice for many workers who preferred to stay close to work at lunch time.

The catering truck industry began getting very competitive as food truck operators became more commonplace. The way to ensure companies would continue doing business with their food trucks, caterers had to diversify their menu items to become more appealing to their customers. Soon catering trucks became specialized eateries offering foods ranging from tacos and burritos to hamburgers and hotdogs, and more exotic foods.

One of the most famous catering trucks is the Kogi truck. Los Angeles is home to hundreds of different cultures and the Kogi truck is a marriage of Mexican and Korean cuisine. People drive for miles to eat a Kogi Kimchi Quesadilla, or a famous spicy pork, or tofu taco. Kogi burritos are just as tasty and exotic. The short rib burrito is one of the favorite items on the menu. Kogi is just one example of the diversity in mobile dining available in Southern California.

Today, the food truck industry is growing larger and larger. Many operators have their own websites so that their customers can see beforehand where they will be parked for the day. The days when catering trucks served only businesses are now over, although they still do catering to businesses, an entire new branch of trucks has hit the streets of Los Angeles.
