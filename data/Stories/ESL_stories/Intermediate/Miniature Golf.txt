One favorite activity for young people in Southern California is visiting a Golf Arcade. The main feature of this attraction is playing miniature golf, which is, as the name suggests, a smaller version of the game of golf. In golf, players play a round of golf that includes either 9, or 18 holes in an open, park-like field where each hole is a great distance from the other. Golfers use a variety of clubs to play a round of golf, including a driver, an iron, and a putter. Each club has its own use. The object of the game is to put a golf ball into the hole in the least number of strokes.

In miniature golf, the course is much smaller. Golf arcades are usually contained within a one-block area, so the game differs greatly from golf. One club is all it takes to play miniature golf, but it is no less fun than playing real golf. A miniature golf course has many themes depending on which course a person visits. Unlike golf, miniature golf has obstacles placed in the path of the golf ball to make it difficult for a person to put the ball in the hole. Miniature golf is usually no more than nine holes.

Golf arcades are not limited to playing miniature golf. Some arcades include mini-car racing on a small, professional-like race track. It is fun to test a person's skills against others in a mini-car race. If racing is not something of interest, there are other activities available. Video games and pinball are popular. The food is another attraction at golf arcades. Most golf arcades serve American favorites like hot dogs, hamburgers, and pizza with all the trimmings. A golf arcade is really a great way to spend a Friday, or Saturday night.
