The backyard barbeque is one of the great American traditions. The first day of summer is June 21, and that date signals the start of the summer grilling season. In places like Southern California, it rarely rains during the summer. Residents of this region get very little tropical conditions during this time. The heat is dry, much like a desert. This means it is a good time to invite friends, neighbors, family, and co-workers to enjoy a summer feast.

Barbeque grills vary greatly in type and size. Some people prefer the propane fueled grills, or a natural gas grill, while others prefer the old-fashioned charcoal briquettes. Of course, there are still grillers who like natural wood-burning grills.

Along with the food, grilling outdoors is a social setting. People get together to have beverages and food, and get caught up with the latest happenings. It's a great way to meet new people and to network with others while having a great time. Additionally, many people bring their children along, and they have fun playing with each other.

The main attraction though is the food. Grillers love experimenting with new spices and sauces to enhance the flavor of their favorite meats. Ribs and chicken are very popular menu items. People can cook just about anything on a grill, such as warming tortillas, toasting bread, grilling onions, corn, and fish. One of the best things about a backyard barbeque afternoon is the wonderful smell of grilling food that carries through the air.

The tradition is especially true on holidays such as the Fourth of July, and Veterans Day, but celebrants do not need an excuse to grill outdoors. All they need is a grill, food, and good company to have a good time.
