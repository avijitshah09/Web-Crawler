One of the most iconic figures in Hollywood today is the venerable, and ageless James Bond. Bond is a fictional character, but that does not mean he does not exist in the collective consciousness of the American public. For generations, the Ian Fleming-inspired, British secret agent has entertained American audiences with his suave demeanor, and grace under fire. Bond first appeared in Fleming's Casino Royale in 1952. The novel followed the exploits of agent 007 as he fought to protect the United Kingdom and the world from disaster. From its beginnings in print, Bond has transitioned to television, film, comics, video games, and radio.

The most famous medium for the super spy is film, however. To date there have been a total of 23 films depicting Bond. The 007 movies are where most Americans came to know James Bond. The first feature film debuted in 1962 with the great Sean Connery starring in the title role in Dr. No. Connery went on to star in six films as Bond. Roger Moore holds the record for depicting 007 in the Bond films, having appeared in seven films from 1973 through 1985. Other actors who have played Bond include George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig, the latest Bond. David Niven starred as Bond in a parody of the franchise.

All of Bond's films have three things in common. They all feature guns, cars, and beautiful leading ladies with exotic, and often erotic names. Some of the most famous actresses to appear in Bond movies are Jane Seymour, Ursula Andress, Britt Ekland, Maud Adams, and Diana Rigg. The most recent film was 2012's Skyfall starring Daniel Craig. The franchise is not showing signs of decline.
