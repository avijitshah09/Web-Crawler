One of the great Los Angeles landmarks is the Memorial Coliseum. The coliseum was first commissioned in 1921, and completed in 1923. The original seating capacity was more than 75,000 seats, and was built as a memorial to World War I veterans. It has since been rededicated as a memorial for all American veterans from all wars. It is a historic stadium, and arguably the most famous outdoor sports arena in the country. Los Angeles was picked by the International Olympic Committee to host the 1932 Olympics. The city leaders realized the stadium was too small, and began a major renovation. It is the only stadium to have hosted two modern Olympic games in the world, but it is much more than that.

The coliseum has also played host to other major league sporting events. It was the site of the 1959 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago White Sox. It played host to the original Super Bowl game in 1967 between the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs. The game was not called the Super Bowl at the time. It was known as the First AFL-NFL World Championship Game. It started what is now the largest annual sporting event in the country, if not the world. Baseball was king during those years, and was, and is still called the Great American Pastime.

The stadium is home to the University of Southern California Trojan football team, which is one of the most historic college teams in the history of the sport. It also was the home field of the UCLA Bruin football team for a number of years. In 1984, the city of Los Angeles and the Coliseum played host to the XXIII Olympic Games, becoming the only stadium to hold that honor. The stadium has played host to World Cup games, boxing matches, and countless concerts, and outdoor events. It is an American tradition that lives on today.
