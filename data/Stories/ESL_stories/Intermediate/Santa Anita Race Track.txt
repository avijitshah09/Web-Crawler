Horse racing is an American tradition dating back to the country's beginnings. In Southern California, there are a variety of tracks, including Santa Anita, Del Mar, Los Alamitos, and the Fairplex. Santa Anita Park is located in Arcadia, California, just a few miles northeast of Los Angeles. The track features thoroughbred horse racing, and is one of the premier tracks in the country. It is located near the base of the San Gabriel Mountains, and is known for its beautiful scenery. Many important races are run yearly, including the Santa Anita Derby and the Santa Anita Handicap. It has also played host to six Breeder's Cup races since 1986.

The park features a one-mile racing track, a 26,000 capacity grandstand to accommodate visitors, 61 barns and more than 2,000 horses. It has an infield park inside the track that can accommodate an additional 50,000 spectators. The infield is one of the most attractive features the park has to offer. It is a setting where people can bring their own food, drinks, chairs, and blankets to enjoy a leisurely day betting on the horses, or just picnicking. It is a beautiful setting for both adults, and children. Not every visitor to the park is a bettor, though. Many people come to Santa Anita just to enjoy the atmosphere, good weather, and food.

There are various ways to bet on a horse at Santa Anita, or at any racetrack. The most common is to bet a horse to win a race. Bettors can also bet on a horse to come in second, which is called to place, or to come in third, called show. Additionally, bettors can place a bet for a horse to win, place, or show, which means a person is betting a horse that will come in at least third. There are other methods for betting, including the Daily Double, where a bettor tries to pick the winner of two horse races that are established by the track. Pick Six is another popular betting venue. In this bet, a bettor picks the winner of six races, which is very difficult, but the payout is substantial.
