Googling something has become a way of life and the person responsible for changing the way people look things up is Larry Page. Today anyone gets the idea to look something up on the Internet, he, or she will probably want to "Google it." The international search engine Google has entered the language of virtually every person who uses the World Wide Web.

Born in East Lansing, Michigan on March 26, 1973, the 41-year-old Page is a business magnate, computer programmer, and co-founder of Google. He currently serves as Chief Executive Officer for the multi-billion dollar company. His current net worth is estimated at $32 billion putting him at No. 19, on Forbes Magazine's list of billionaires.

Page comes from a computer science pedigree. His father was a professor at the University of Michigan, where Larry Page graduated with honors. Larry went on to earn his Master of Science from Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.

From an early age Page has been interested in finding out how mechanical things work. He credits his older brother for showing him how to take things apart, and to reassemble them, but invention is what interests Page the most. Page began his first Google page while still a student at Stanford. He developed a new algorithm that was superior to every search engine in use in 1996. This site at Stanford would evolve to the Google search engine today.

Google has been ranked as the No. 1 search engine in the world. It operates more than one million servers in data centers throughout the world to accommodate an estimated one billion searches per day. It also owns the popular video playing website YouTube. Google generates nearly $13 billion in net sales per year.
