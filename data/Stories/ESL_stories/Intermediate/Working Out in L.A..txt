One of the major trends happening today in the United States is physical fitness. For many years, Americans led the world in deaths due to heart disease related to obesity. America is a society on the move; so many people do not take the time to eat properly. What happens in a typical day is that Americans turn to fast food restaurants whenever they are in a rush. Some of the more popular fast food restaurants are McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box, Carl's Jr., and White Castle. All these places offer a quick bite to eat at an economical price. However, the quality of the food has been suspect for years.

The fitness craze began as early as the 1970s, when people became aware that the fast food giants were serving food that promoted obesity. Coupled with beverage industry companies like Coca Cola, Pepsi, and 7UP, Americans were consuming too much salt in their food, and too much sugar in their beverages. Having realized the problem, Americans began making healthier eating choices. Those companies have also made major adjustments in the food they offer. Today, along with the old menu items such as hamburgers, fries, and sodas, the fast food restaurants now offer grilled chicken sandwiches and salads, too.

More Americans exercise on a regular basis these days, which helps promote a healthy metabolism and improve stamina. It also helps control blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Because of the healthy eating and exercise trends going on in America today, death rate has been reduced significantly. Most Americans grew up on fried, greasy food, but more and more people are making the right food choices. Americans are adaptable people.
