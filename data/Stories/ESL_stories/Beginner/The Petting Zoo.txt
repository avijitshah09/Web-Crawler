Joy was going to the petting zoo. She was excited. It was going to be her first time seeing animals. When her dad parked the car, she opened the car door right away. "Joy, wait for us!" her dad said. Once her mom and dad got out, Joy made them run to the zoo with her. They arrived. Joy saw the animals. Her smile disappeared. The animals were not that impressive. There were only rabbits, horses, and dogs. They were very boring. She was hoping to see more wild animals. "Let's go home," Joy said. "No way, we came all the way here to pet animals!" her dad said.
