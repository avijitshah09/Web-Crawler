"I don't like John," she told her husband. "Why don't you like John?" he asked his wife. She said that John said bad things about Americans. He said Americans are lazy. He said Americans are greedy. He said Americans are selfish. He said Americans are unfriendly. John said the people in his country aren't lazy. The people in his country aren't greedy. The people in his country aren't selfish. The people in his country aren't unfriendly. "But John is new here," said her husband. "He doesn't know anyone yet. He doesn't have any friends. When he has new friends, he will change his mind. He will say different things. He will say good things about Americans." He told his wife to be patient. She didn't want to be patient. "A new person shouldn't say bad things," she said. "He should go back to his country."
