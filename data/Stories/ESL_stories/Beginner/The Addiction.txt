Yvonne is addicted to biting her nails. She doesn't know how it started. She has been biting her nails since she was four years old. She bites her nails when she is not doing anything with her hands; she bites her nails when listening to her professor or waiting in line. People around her are grossed out by her habit, but Yvonne can't help it.

Her addiction is getting worse. Yvonne now has an infection on the tips of her fingers. Her fingernails are also yellow. When Yvonne noticed all this, she realized that she needed to make a big change. Yvonne decided to paint her nails to stop herself from biting them since she doesn't want to bite on the nail polish.

Yvonne was in class listening to a boring lecture, which made her want to bite her nails. She looked at her blue nails and stopped herself. Ten minutes later, she looked at her nails again. She started sweating and tapping her foot. The girl sitting next to her asked if she was okay. Yvonne couldn't take it anymore. She just had to bite her nails again.
