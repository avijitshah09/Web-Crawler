Rain water dripped down the window. Lightning flashed from the sky. There was no one outside. There was a storm coming. He had a plan for tonight. The plan was canceled because of the coming storm. Outside looked gloomy. The sidewalks were wet and looked gray. The trees swayed back and fourth. The wind was blowing hard. There were tree branches and leaves on the ground. He was safe inside his home. He turned on his television to watch the five o'clock news. The weather man came on. He warned everyone to stay inside. The storm was to last all through the night. It was cold inside his home. He turned on his heater. Thunder roared from outside. Suddenly, the light went out. There was no more electricity. He lit some candles and grabbed a flashlight. The storm was going on. He fell asleep on the couch. He woke up in the morning. The storm had ended.
