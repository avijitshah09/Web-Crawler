Ken had no school today. Ken had no chores to do today. Ken was not working today. He was all alone at home. He had the day off. He was usually busy every day. He watched TV for two hours. He got bored. He played video games. He got bored. He went to a cafe. He ordered coffee and bread. He ate it. He got bored. He jogged in the park. He got bored. He called his friends. They were busy. He suddenly wished he was busy. He called his work place. He asked his boss if he could come in. His boss laughed. Ken hung up. What a boring day.
