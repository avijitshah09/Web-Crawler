David was a short man. He had always been the smallest boy in class. As an adult he barely even passed five feet. His height made David's self-esteem very low. He wanted to change that.

David had always liked sports. Sadly, short people have a hard time fitting in on most sport teams. "Have you thought about becoming a horse jockey?" asked a friend. David decided to give it a try.

The next day, David visited the local race track. David didn't even get a chance to introduce himself. Three people came up to ask if he was interested in joining their racing team. His height was finally a huge advantage. David fit right in.
