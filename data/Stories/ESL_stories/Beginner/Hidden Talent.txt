Annie Hall is 5'1". She weighs a little less than 110 pounds. Although she is twenty, she looks more like a twelve-year-old. Annie has an unexpected talent. She is a national champion at hot dog eating competitions. These competitions take place in carnivals around the United States. Annie is one of the few women who compete. She is also one of the smallest.

Even though she is tiny, she beats most of the big, fat men. She can eat about 37 hot dogs in 12 minutes. "The men underestimate me," says Annie. "I love surprising everyone each time."
