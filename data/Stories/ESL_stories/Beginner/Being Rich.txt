Patricia went to a private university. She couldn't afford it herself. She was lucky to receive a scholarship to pay for her. Many other people at the school were very rich. This made Patricia uncomfortable sometimes.

All her classmates dressed in expensive clothing. Patricia could barely even pay for her books. The last thing she was going to spend money on was clothing. Her classmates all drove fancy sports cars. Patricia took the bus to school. She was embarrassed for not having money.

"Don't worry," said her mom. Soon you're going to graduate. You will get a great job with your degree. One day, you will be as rich as them. Maybe you will be even richer.
