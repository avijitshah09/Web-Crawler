Jen is poor. Her dad left when she was seven years old. Her mom didn't go to college, so she can't get any good jobs. Jen wishes she could get a job, but she is only 13 years old. Jen also wants to be part of the cool group. The cool group buys expensive clothes, shoes, makeup, and jewelry. Jen always wear really simple things, like a t-shirt.

One of the girls in the cool group is Jen's cousin. Her name is Dana. Dana convinced the cool group to invite Jen on a shopping trip. Jen is excited. She wants to convince them that she is cool enough to be a part of the group. When Jen sees them, she feels bad about herself. They are all dressing so much nicer than her. Jen tries to ignore this. She and the cool group go inside Rural Insiders, the most popular store for teenagers. Everything is so expensive though.

All of the girls in the group except Jen stand in line to buy something. "Are you going to get anything, Jen?" asks one of the girls. "Yeah!" Jen says. She grabs a dress. It is $80! She buys the dress, but she plans to return it.
