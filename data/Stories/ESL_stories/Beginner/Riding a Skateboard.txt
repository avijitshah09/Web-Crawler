Michael wanted to learn something new. He wanted to do something adventurous. He decided to learn how to ride a motorcycle. His parents said no. They said it was too dangerous. He decided to learn how to ride a skateboard instead. His parents agreed to this. It was much safer than learning how to ride a motorcycle. Michael called his friends. His friends knew how to ride a skateboard. They let him borrow their skateboard. Michael tried it slowly. He held the fence. He slowly balanced himself. This was not so hard. He then fell. He laughed it off. He needed more practice.
