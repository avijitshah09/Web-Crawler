Clara always thought her eyebrows were too bushy. Having good eyebrows was becoming a very popular trend among girls. Clara's friend, Rachel, offered to take her to a salon to wax her eyebrows. Clara didn't like that idea. She didn't want a stranger to be so close to her face. Rachel offered to give Clara waxing products so she can fix her eyebrows herself. Clara said okay.

Clara went over to Rachel's house to get the eyebrow waxing material. She then went to Rachel's bathroom. Clara was nervous. What if she did it wrong? She slowly spread the wax on her eyebrows. A couple minutes later, she pulled the wax off. "Ouch!" Clara yelled.

Clara looked in the mirror. Her eyebrows were gone! She had accidentally pulled off too much of it. She screamed. Rachel went in the bathroom to check on her. "I heard screaming, what's wrong?" Rachel asked. Clara turned around and pointed at her face. Rachel tried to hide her laugh. "It's not funny," Clara said. "Well it kinda is, because you were worried that you had too much hair before, and now you have none," Rachel said.
