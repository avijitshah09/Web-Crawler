James woke up. He had to get ready for school. He looked in the mirror. There was a big, red bump on his forehead. It was a pimple. He was worried. He wanted it to be gone. He washed his face. The pimple was still there. He popped the pimple with his fingers. It was still there. It looked even worse. It was very red. He tried covering it. He asked his sister for makeup. She laughed at him. Forget it, he thought. Later, he went on his computer. He looked up ways to get rid of it. There was no instant way. He just had to be patient.
