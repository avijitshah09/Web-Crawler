Jack Miller was angry at his neighbors. "They are so inconsiderate!" he said. These neighbors were very loud. They owned three dogs, two birds, and one goat. None of these animals ever shut up. Even more, they loved playing music all day. Jack would not mind this. However, his neighbors played it loud enough for the whole block to hear. "It wouldn't be so bad, if their music wasn't terrible," said Jack.

Luckily, these neighbors soon moved out. Jack couldn't be happier. He would finally enjoy peace and quiet. Unfortunately, the new neighbors arrived with a baby. This baby cried just as loud as all the other things put together.
