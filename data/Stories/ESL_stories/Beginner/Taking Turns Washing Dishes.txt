Victoria and Linda are sisters. Their parents make them wash dishes. They take turns. Victoria washes the dishes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Linda washes the dishes on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. On Sunday, they flip a coin. Today it was Victoria's turn to wash dishes. Linda took advantage of this. She used three dishes at dinner. She had one dish for rice, one dish for meat, and another dish for dessert. "Why do you have to make me wash more?" Victoria yelled. "It's fair," Linda said. Victoria never did that to Linda. She planned to make Linda wash more dishes tomorrow.
