Clark had a lot of passions. He liked science. He was a great swimmer. He was even great at singing. However, his biggest passion was pizza. He loved pizza.

Clark graduated from college with a degree in chemistry. His parents were so excited for his future. "You're going to make a great doctor!" they always said. Clark did not want to be a doctor. All he wanted was to open up his own pizza place. "That's ridiculous," said his mother. "Think about how much money you could make as a doctor!" Clark did not care about money. All he wanted was to spend every day making, smelling, and eating pizzas.
