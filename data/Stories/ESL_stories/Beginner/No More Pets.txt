Jackie Davis had never owned a pet. She had always wanted one. She decided to go to the pet store. She bought a fish. "This should be pretty easy to take care of," she thought. The fish died after one week. "The water must have been dirty!" Jackie said. She had only fed the fish once.

Jackie went back to the pet store. She decided she was ready for something bigger. She bought a bird. The bird died after two weeks. "He was probably sick!" said Jackie. She ignored the empty food plate.

Jackie visited the pet store one more time. She bought a dog. Within one week, the dog ran away. He was very hungry. He had run after a taco truck.
