Kyla loves her little sister. Her name is Brenda. She is very annoying though. Brenda talks way too much. She talks very loudly, too. Kyla had an idea. "Let's play the quiet game! I bet you can't win!" Kyla said. "I totally can!" Brenda said. Brenda was surprisingly good at the game. She did not talk for an entire day. Kyla was happy. However, Brenda continued playing the next day. Kyla missed hearing her sister's voice. Brenda even played the quiet game at school. Her teachers were mad that Brenda was not participating in class. "You win, Brenda," Kyla said.
