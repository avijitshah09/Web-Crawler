Joseph had a new job. He was a security guard for his favorite band. He thought it would be the best job ever. He would get to listen to the band play every night. He would even get paid for it!

Joseph quit the job after the first night. He was walking the band into their tour bus. Suddenly a mob of crazy girls started chasing them. He thought he could handle the girls. He was very wrong. They were much stronger than they looked. Joseph ended up with a black eye and a scratched up face. "This pain isn't worth the money," said Joseph.
