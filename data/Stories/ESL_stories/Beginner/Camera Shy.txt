Charlie was camera shy. He did not like having his photo taken. He often ran away from a camera. Charlie and his friends were in Hawaii. Bob wanted to take a group picture. He thought the beach would be a great place to do it. Charlie began to get nervous. His friends got closer together. Charlie walked away.

"Charlie, come on!" they said. Charlie ignored them. Bob put his camera down. He ran after him. "Charlie, you know why pictures are important?" he asked. Charlie shook his head. "When you're old, you and your kids will want to see how you looked like when you were young," Bob said.
