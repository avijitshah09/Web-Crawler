Zoe hated her boss Justin, who thought he was better than everyone just because he went to Harvard. He proudly hung up his diploma in his office. Zoe knew that she was smart and capable, but she could never rise up with Justin as her boss. She knew she had to work somewhere else. Zoe submitted her letter of resignation.

She went into Justin's office to talk. There were pictures of himself all over the walls. There was a picture of him modelling a suit, a picture of him meeting the mayor, and more. Zoe laughed. "Something funny?" Justin asked. Zoe shook her head. "Anyways, I was wondering why you decided to quit. You have worked here for six years and have been doing well," Justin said.

"I just feel that it's time to move on to bigger things," Zoe said. "Oh, so this company is not good enough for you?" Justin asked. "To be honest, I just don't like the way you run this company," Zoe said. Justin turned red with anger. He hit his desk and started tearing down all the pictures on the walls. He left Zoe in his office and slammed the door on his way out. Zoe just laughed.
