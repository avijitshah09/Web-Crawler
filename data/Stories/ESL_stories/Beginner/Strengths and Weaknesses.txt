Howard had recently made the soccer team. However, he has been having trouble with the captain and keeping up with his teammates. Howard wasn't in shape as the rest of the guys. He also couldn't do a lot of things that the guys did. Howard knew that the only reason he made the team was because he made a goal during tryouts. The goal he made was lucky though. The coach quickly realized this after the first week of practice.

The coach set up a meeting to talk to Howard. "Do you know what this is about?" the coach asked. Howard nodded. "Your performance has not been so good compared to the others. It also seems like you're having a lot of trouble," the coach said. "Yeah, I didn't grow up playing soccer," Howard said. "You're going to have a lot of trouble if you stay on the team. If you still want to play, I think you should take classes and try out again next year." Howard sighed. He knew the coach was right, but he was still sad.

Howard cried. The coach put his arm around him. "Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Soccer is not your strength, but you are probably good at something else. My strength is playing soccer, but my weakness is playing instruments," the coach said. Howard felt a lot better after hearing him say that. Howard knew that he had strengths, he just had to find out what they were.
