Andre was 12 years old. A lot of 12-year-old boys get pimples. Andre saw a pimple on his forehead in the morning. He had never gotten one before. He screamed. He did not know what it was. "Mom! There's an alien on my face!" Andre yelled. His mom put her hand under his chin. She looked at his forehead and laughed. "It's not funny!" Andre said. "Honey, it's just a pimple. Everyone gets one from time to time," his mom said. Andre felt a little better when she said that. His mom gave him some pimple cream. Andre hoped it would go away soon.
