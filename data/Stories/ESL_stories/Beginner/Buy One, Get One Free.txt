Brandy was shopping. She saw a sign that said "BOGO!" She asked a worker what that meant. "It means buy one, get one free," she said. She thought that was awesome. What a good deal! She looked through the clothing racks. She found a shirt for $30. She had to find something else now. She saw a skirt she liked. It was only $5. That meant it wasn't worth it.

She wanted to get two items that were similar in price, but she couldn't find anything. She looked for an hour. She found a pretty dress. She checked the price tag. It was $80. She was annoyed. She ended up buying the shirt and the $5 skirt.
