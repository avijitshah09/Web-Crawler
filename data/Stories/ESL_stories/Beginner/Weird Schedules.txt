Finn has a strange sleeping schedule. He goes to sleep at 5 A.M. and wakes up at 3 P.M. He has a weird eating schedule, too. He eats breakfast at 3:30 P.M. He eats lunch at 7 P.M. He eats dinner at 1 A.M.

One day, he was feeling hungry at 1 A.M. He did not want to cook though. He decided to go to a 24/7 diner. 24/7 means always available. He drove down to the diner. There were a few people there. Finn sat on a stool by himself. He ordered a burger and a milkshake.
