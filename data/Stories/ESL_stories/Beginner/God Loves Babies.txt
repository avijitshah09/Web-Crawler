You will have eight babies." The wife couldn't believe it. Her husband couldn't believe it. Eight babies! "We will have a big family," said the husband. "We will have a very big family," said the wife. "But how can we pay for all these babies?" asked the husband. "We can pay for one baby. But eight babies cost a lot of money. How can we pay for eight babies?" The wife said, "We will find a way. God will help us find a way." They both smiled. They would have a big happy family.
