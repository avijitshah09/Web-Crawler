He was painting the wall with a spray gun. He was painting the wall white. The wall was part of the 99 Cents store. The store had big glass windows. The painter had taped plastic over the windows. Plastic covered the big glass windows. The painter wore goggles over his eyes. The goggles covered his eyes. Customers walked into the store. Customers walked out of the store. They walked under the ladder. They walked under the painter. Tiny drops of paint fell on the customers. Tiny drops of paint fell on the cars. Tiny drops of paint fell on the sidewalk. The painter didn't care. Tiny drops of paint were not his problem.
