Brad and his friends needed something to do. They had no idea what to do. It was a Saturday morning. Brad's friend, Jeremy suggested they go rock climbing. None of them had ever been. Brad agreed and said it would be a good idea.

They drove to the rock climbing place. They paid 10 dollars to go inside. They saw all the walls and harnesses. Brad and his friends got excited. They started to get all their equipment. They raced. Jeremy was the first one to climb the whole wall. All of them had tons of fun. They did not want to go home.
