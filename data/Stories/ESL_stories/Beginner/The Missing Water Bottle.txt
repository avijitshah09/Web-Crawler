Jared has a green water bottle that he brings to school every day. He loves it, because it keeps his water cold. It also has a cool robot on it. One day, he loses it. Jared asks his friend, Richard, if he has seen it. "Yeah, I saw Albert holding it," Richard says. Jared walks over to Richard's locker. "Hey, you have my water bottle, right?" Jared asks. "I did, but I let Denise borrow it," Albert says.

Jared goes up to Denise. "Hey, do you have my water bottle?" Denise shakes her head and says, "I thought it was cool looking, so I showed Amanda. She has it now. Jared goes to Amanda. "Amanda, tell me you have my water bottle." Amanda shakes her head. "I thought it was Lucas', so I gave it to him. Jared screams in frustration.

Jared goes to Lucas. "Do you have my water bottle?" Jared asks. "I gave it to Richard to give to you," Lucas says. That was weird since Richard was the first person he asked about the water bottle. Jared went back to Richard. "Lucas said you had my water bottle," Jared said. "I told you, I saw Albert hold it. Lucas probably meant Richard Lopez, not me," Richard said. "I'm just going to buy a new water bottle," Jared said. He bought a blue one this time.
