He went to a bicycle shop. He wanted to buy a bike. His old bike was too old. It had stopped working. He entered the bike shop. There were bikes all around. There were bikes on the walls. There were bikes in aisles. Some bikes were even hung upside-down from the ceiling. He knew what bike he wanted. He approached the sales man. He told him what bike he wanted. The sales man took him to a room. There were more bikes in the room. He liked what he saw. He quickly chose a bike to buy. It was a small black bike. He paid for it and rode it home. It cost him five hundred dollars. It was worth the price. He used the bike for tricks and stunts. He never fell. He was a professional bike rider.
