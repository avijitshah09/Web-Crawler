Sarah's car wasn't turning on. She checked the engine. She saw the problem. One of her pipes was loose. She would have to buy a new piece to fix it. Sarah headed to the local auto shop.

After she bought the pipe, an employee offered to help her put it in the car. "No thanks," said Sarah. "I can do it myself." The employee laughed when she said this. "What's so funny?" asked Sarah. "Girls don't know how to fix cars," said the man employee.

Sarah was furious. She almost smacked him with the pipe. Instead, she talked to his manager. Then, on her way out the door, she knocked a shelf over. "I hope men know how to clean,'" she said.
