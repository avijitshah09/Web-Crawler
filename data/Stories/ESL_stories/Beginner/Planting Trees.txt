Sarah learned about plants in science class. She learned that plants help people. She learned that every year people destroy rainforests. This includes trees. She learned that without trees there would be no oxygen for us to breathe. She decided to organize a club at her school. It was called Project Green. They would work on planting trees. Although it would not solve all the problems, planting trees was a good way to help the environment. It was also fun to meet with other people. They gathered on saturday. Each person was in charge of a different job. There was only 20 people in the group before. After the school heard about what they did, their club grew. The following week there were a hundred members.
