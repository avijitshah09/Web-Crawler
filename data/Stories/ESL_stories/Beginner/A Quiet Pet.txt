She didn't have a bird. "Can I have a dog, Daddy?" Lisa asked. Daddy said no. He said a dog barked too much. "Can I have a cat, Daddy?" Lisa asked. Daddy said no. He said a cat meowed too much. "Can I have a bird, Daddy?" Lisa asked. Daddy said no. He said a bird sang too much. "All my friends have pets. Can't I have just one pet?" she asked. "Okay," Daddy said. "But it must be a quiet pet. I'll buy you a quiet pet." He went to the pet store. He bought a pet. He gave Lisa her new pet. "Daddy, it's a goldfish!" Lisa said.
