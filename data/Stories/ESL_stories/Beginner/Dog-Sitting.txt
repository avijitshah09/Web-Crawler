Teresa's neighbors were out of town. They had two dogs. One was a german shepherd. The other was a terrier. They told Teresa that they would be gone for three days, and asked her if she could watch their dogs. Teresa agreed. She loved dogs.

She went over the next day. She brought the dogs back to her house. She fed them and played with them. Later she walked the dogs. They walked around the block and then went to the park. She took them to play with other dogs. Teresa had fun taking care of the dogs. Her neighbors came back. They thanked Teresa. They brought Teresa a gift from their vacation.
