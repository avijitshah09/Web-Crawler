"Let's go to the beach, Daddy," Susan suggested. "That sounds like a good idea," her daddy replied. It was a hot, sunny day. The ocean was only two blocks away. Susan went into her room. She put on her swimsuit. She grabbed a big beach towel. She put on a hat and grabbed her sunglasses. She put on her flip-flops. "I'm ready, Daddy," she said. "Do you have any sunscreen?" he asked. "No, I forgot. Where is it?" she asked. He told her it was in the top drawer in the bathroom. She went into the bathroom and opened the drawer. "I've got it," she said. They walked outside. The sun was bright. Susan put on her sunglasses. She loved to wear her sunglasses. They made her look like an adult. She gave the beach towel to her dad. She grabbed her dad's hand and they started walking. Ten minutes later they were at the beach. It was crowded. Dad found a spot. He put the beach towel on the sand. Susan took off her hat and sunglasses. She ran into the water. Dad watched her play in the water. She was having fun. Suddenly a wave knocked her over. She went under water. Dad ran into the water. He pulled her up. "Daddy, I almost drowned," Susan said. "No, you didn't," he said. "That wave only knocked you over. Don't worry. I'm watching you."
