Shirley went to the mall with her friends. They walk in. There are so many stores. They first go to a candle shop. The shop is having a huge sale. Shirley picks up a green candle and smells it. It smells like a pine cone forest. It reminds her of her grandfather. He passed away two years ago. She feels that she should visit him. She decides to buy the candle. Shirley drops her friends off at their houses. She drives to the cemetery. She puts the candle on her grandfather's tombstone. She smiles. He would like the candle. She drives back home.
