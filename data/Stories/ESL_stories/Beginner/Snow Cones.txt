It was the last day of the summer day camp. It was hot, almost 100 degrees. The counselors needed a way to cool off the kids. After talking, the counselors decided to give out snow cones. The snow cones would be made out of ice and syrup. There were different flavors -- strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry. Some kids got one flavor. Some kids mixed them together.

All the kids loved the snow cones. It was a fun day. Everyone enjoyed their treat. Snow cones were a success. After the kids had their snow cones, they went to the playground. The snow cones helped cool them off.
