He walked into the bathroom. He turned on the water and rinsed his face. He picked up the can of shaving cream. He put some shaving cream onto his fingers. He spread the shaving cream all over his face and neck. He picked up the razor. He shaved both sides of his face. Then he shaved his upper lip. He shaved his chin. Then he shaved his neck. He started from the bottom of his neck and stroked upwards. He shaved carefully around his Adam's apple. He rinsed out the razor. He rinsed his face completely to remove all the shaving cream. He dried his face with a towel and looked in the mirror. There was no shaving cream on his face. He was finished.
