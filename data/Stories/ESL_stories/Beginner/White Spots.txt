Mark heard a noise. What was the noise? It was a steady noise. It wasn't a loud noise. It was a steady, quiet noise. He opened his apartment door. He looked outside. A painter was next door. A painter was spray painting a fence. He was spray painting the fence next door. He was spray painting the fence white. Mark walked downstairs. He walked over to his car. His car was dark blue. He looked for tiny white spots on his dark blue car. He didn't see any tiny white spots. He got into his car. He drove it out to the street. He parked his car on the street. He went back upstairs. The painter finished painting the fence. Mark went out to his car. He saw big white spots on his blue car. He looked up in the tree. He saw a big, black bird in the tree.
