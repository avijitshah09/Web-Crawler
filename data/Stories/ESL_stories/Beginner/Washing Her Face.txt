Eileen was woken up by her alarm. She did not want to wake up. But she had to. She had a test at 8 A.M. Washing her face helped a lot. She went to the bathroom. She did not want to use the cold water, but cold water wakes her up. Warm water does not make her more awake. She closed her eyes. She splashed the cold water on her face. She felt ready for school. She made herself a cup of coffee. She drank the whole thing. She felt awake.
