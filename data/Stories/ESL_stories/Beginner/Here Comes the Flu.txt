Jason read the news. He watched the news. He listened to the news. The swine flu was coming. The swine flu was dangerous. The swine flu was a killer. It killed people. Everyone should get a shot. Jason was not worried about the swine flu. He was healthy. "I am as healthy as a horse," he said. "I never get the flu. I never get sick." Jason was a talk show host. He talked on the radio. He talked for three hours every day. He said, "I'm not getting a swine flu shot." A doctor called Jason. The doctor told Jason to get a shot. He said, "Come to my office. I'll give you a free shot." Jason said no. He was as healthy as a horse. One month later, Jason didn't go to work. He didn't go to work for a week. He had the swine flu.
