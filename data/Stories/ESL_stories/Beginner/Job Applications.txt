It was summer. He needed money to pay for school next year. He decided to get a job. He needed to apply to different places. He first made a resume. He then made a cover letter. He walked around his neighborhood. He asked managers if they were hiring. By the end of the day he found 10 different places that were hiring. They were mostly retail or restaurant jobs. He wanted to work nearby. He filled out the applications. The next day he handed them in. Tom was hopeful. Two weeks later he received phone calls. They wanted him to be interviewed for the job.
