The house phone was ringing. She went downstairs. It was dark. She watched her steps and slowly went down the stairs. "Who is calling?" she wondered. She got downstairs. The phone was in the kitchen. She reached for the light switch. She turned on the lights. She squint her eyes. The light was bright. She was blinded by the lights. The phone was still ringing. She walked to the kitchen barefoot. She stepped on a toy. She jumped in pain. She looked at the floor. She had stepped on a Lego toy. She had a son. He never picked up his toys. She reached the kitchen. The phone was still ringing. She picked up the phone. She looked at the caller ID. It was an unknown number. She answered the phone: "Hello." There was no reply. The phone clicked. It was a wrong number.
