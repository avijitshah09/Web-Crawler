Jason Parker was looking for a job. He had applied to ten positions. Still, no one was hiring him. He didn't understand why no place wanted him. Jason had a positive and confident personality. His references proved he was reliable. He couldn't see anything wrong with himself.

He asked his friends what they thought was wrong. "It's your beard!" they all said. Jason didn't believe them. He thought his beard was attractive and manly. "It doesn't look good on you," his friends said. "You look homeless and dirty." After that Jason shaved the beard off. He hated it, but he was hired in his next interview.
