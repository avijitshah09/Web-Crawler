She woke up one morning and felt hungry. She did not eat anything last night. She got out of bed, and walked into her kitchen. The kitchen was clean. She thought about what to eat for breakfast. She opened her refrigerator and took out a carton of eggs. She opened her cabinet, and reached for a bowl. She cracked four eggs into the bowl. She stirred the eggs with a spoon. She turned on the stove, and placed a pan on the stove. She turned the knob on the stove. The fire was lit. She grabbed a stick of butter from the fridge. She tossed the butter on the hot pan. She grabbed the bowl of eggs and threw them on the pan. She scrambled them with a spatula. The eggs cooked in minutes. They smelled delicious.
