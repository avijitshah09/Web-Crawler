Talent shows are typically held at schools for younger students. They allow students to be creative. People do many different things. Some students sing. Some students dance. Some students act. Some students do magic tricks. Some students play instruments. Some students tell jokes. Sometimes, students get more creative. Some students get stage fright. Sometimes, these students throw up. But it's okay, the audience cheers for them still. Kids need support. Sometimes talent shows have winners. But other times, everyone is a winner.
