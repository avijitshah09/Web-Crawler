Kenneth Baker woke up early Sunday morning. A terrible thing had happened. His cat was missing. "He must have run away again," thought Kenneth. He went around asking neighbors for information. "That's odd," said his neighbor Sandra. "My Chihuahua went missing last night, too!"

Kenneth kept walking around the neighborhood. He hoped to find his cat roaming the streets. Instead, Kenneth found something else. There were signs everywhere. They all said, "Missing cat" or "Missing Dog".

"I don't think all these animals are running away," though Kenneth. Then, Kenneth saw something that broke his heart. There was a trail of blood on the floor. It led to the mountain side. A coyote must be taking all the small pets in the night.
