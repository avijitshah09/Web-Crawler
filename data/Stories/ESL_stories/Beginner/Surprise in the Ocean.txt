Kimberly and Jason were surfing. They did this every weekend. They were far into the ocean. Suddenly, something touched Jason's foot. Jason froze.

"Is something wrong?" asked Kimberly. "Don't move," Jason replied. "I think there's a shark under us." Kimberly panicked. She put goggles on. Then, she looked under the water.

When she came back up, she had a big smile on her face. She was laughing very loud. "This isn't funny!" said Jason. Suddenly, a baby seal jumped onto Jason's surf board. Jason screamed and jumped into the water. He hid there for almost a minute. "That's the shark!" said Kimberly. Jason was very embarrassed.
