John was new to Los Angeles. He had never lived in a city before. He used to live on a farm. He had loved the city so far.

One evening, John agreed to meet his friends in downtown L.A. He was late to their dinner. He couldn't find parking anywhere. A stranger walked up to his window. "I can park your car for you," he said. John thought this man was valet.

John thanked the man and gave him his keys. After dinner, John couldn't find the valet booth. "We don't have valet," said a waiter. John's car had been stolen. Even though he like the city, he did not like the people.
