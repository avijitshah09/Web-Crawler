George's best friend was visiting him. Joseph lived in Arizona. George moved to Los Angeles two years ago. He hadn't seen Joseph since then. George wanted his friend to have fun. He wanted to convince him to move to Los Angeles with him. George had a great idea. He would take his friend to Six Flags. They didn't have big roller coasters in Arizona.

George and Joseph got on a ride called Tatsu. It was huge and had more than five loops. Joseph screamed more than any other persons. "Isn't this great?" asked George. "If you move here, we'll be coming here all the time!" Joseph never returned to Los Angeles again.
