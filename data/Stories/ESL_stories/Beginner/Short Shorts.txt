Lisa Adams was going out with friends. She was about to walk out of the house. Her mom stopped her. "What are you wearing?" shouted Mrs. Adams.

"They're just shorts!" replied Lisa. Mrs. Adams thought they looked more like underwear. "You're not going out wearing those!" she said. Lisa said that wasn't fair. After half an hour of arguing, Mrs. Adams let Lisa leave.

The next day, Mrs. Adams and Lisa went out to lunch. Mrs. Adams wore a tank top and very short shorts. "What are you wearing?" shouted Lisa. She was embarrassed to walk around with her mom showing her butt. "They're just shorts!" replied Mrs. Adams.
