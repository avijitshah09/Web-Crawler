Karen looked out the window. There were drops of water on the window. It was starting to rain. Dogs began barking. The clouds started getting dark. Karen had planned to play soccer with her friends. She had to cancel the plan. She was sad at first. She then started to read her book. Rainy weather was the perfect time to read!

She made herself a cup of hot chocolate. She sat on her couch. She put a blanket over herself. She opened her book. It was interesting. She read 100 pages in an hour. She heard her phone ring. "Karen! Let's go play soccer! It stopped raining," her friend said. Karen did not want to go anymore. She wanted to read her book. "I'm going to stay in," Karen said. She continued reading.
