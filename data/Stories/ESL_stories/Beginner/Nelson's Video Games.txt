Nelson loves video games. As soon as he wakes up, he starts playing. Nelson hardly ever turns his games off. He only stops playing to eat and sleep. Sometimes he stays up all night playing. His mother tries to make him stop. "Go play with your friends", she tells him. "Don't just sit there all day."

The only friends Nelson has are video game players, too. They never see each other. They only talk through the computer. "I am playing with my friends!" Nelson always replies. Nelson's mom is worried about him. She thinks he is lonely. She also thinks he is getting very fat. She does not know how to help Nelson. Instead, she goes out to buy him new games.
