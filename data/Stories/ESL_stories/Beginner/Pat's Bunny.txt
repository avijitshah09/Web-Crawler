Pat found a bunny. She found it on the street. There was blood on the bunny. It looked like it was in pain. Pat did not want to leave it alone. She carried it home. She put it in a shoe box. She asked her mom if she could keep it. Her mom said no. The bunny might have rabies. Pat took the bunny to the veterinarian. The bunny probably could not live. It was too injured. Pat asked her mom again if she could keep it. She said that the bunny would die in a week. Her mom said okay. Pat took really good care of the bunny.
