Zack won a ticket to an amusement park. He won it from a dance contest. He had years of experience, so it was easy for him to win. He packed up all his belongings to go to the amusement park. He was planning to meet his friends there.

He got in his sports car. He drove to the amusement park. He went up to the ticket counter. "Welcome! May I see your ticket?" asked the employee. He reached into his pocket. Nothing was there. He started sweating. He emptied out his backpack. It was not there. He must have left it at home.
