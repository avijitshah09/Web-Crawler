Eileen had to see the doctor. She had no appointment. She had to wait for two hours to see the doctor. She was bored. She forgot her phone. She didn't know what to do. She looked around. Everyone had a phone.

She looked to see if there were any magazines. Waiting rooms usually had magazines. There were magazines in Spanish. Eileen can't read Spanish. She turned on the TV. There was no cable. Eileen did not like local television. It was too boring. She turned off the TV. She tried to talk to the person next to her. The person ignored her. He was on his phone. She wished she brought her phone.
