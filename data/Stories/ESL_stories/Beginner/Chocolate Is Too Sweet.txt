Susie likes to eat chocolate. She really likes chocolate with caramel. Her mom gives her a chocolate bar. Susie is happy. She bites the bar. It is tasty. She starts to get thirsty. The chocolate is too sweet. "Mom, can you get me a drink?" she asks. Her mom gives her a drink. Susie drinks it. It is chocolate milk.

"Too sweet!" Susie yells. "You never said what kind of drink you wanted," her mom says. Susie gets up from her seat. She grabs a water bottle. She drinks a lot of water. "Much better," she says. She continues eating the chocolate.
