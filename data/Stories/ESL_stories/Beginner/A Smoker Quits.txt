I will quit smoking tomorrow. I swear it. I promise. I'm not kidding. I'm serious this time. I just bought my last pack of cigarettes. I'm going to smoke all 20 cigarettes before midnight. And then I'm finished. I'm through. I'm done. No more. Not one more cigarette. Not even one. I will be free. I will save $4 a day, more than $1,000 a year. That will be nice. I will have fresh breath. My girlfriend will enjoy kissing me. I will smell good. My clothes will smell good. My lungs will get healthy. My teeth will get whiter. I won't get lung cancer. I won't get mouth cancer. I won't get throat cancer. My cough will go away. My sore throat will go away. I won't think about cigarettes all the time. I will start a new life. My new life will be a healthy life, without cigarettes.
