Daniel caught a cold. He had fever and chills. His nose was running all day. He couldn't even stop sneezing. Daniel visited the doctor. He was told to rest and relax. "Stay in bed for three days," said the doctor.

Daniel did not listen. His friends wanted to go swimming. "Come with us!" they told him. "You'll be fine." Daniel and his friends stayed in the pool until late at night.

The next morning, Daniel felt terrible. His voice was completely gone. He was shaking all morning. He stayed this way for five days. He called his doctor for help. "You didn't listen to me, did you?" his doctor asked.
