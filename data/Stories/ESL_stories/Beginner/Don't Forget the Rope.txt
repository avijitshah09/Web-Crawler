Thomas went camping with his friends. They thought they were prepared. They had packed their tents. They bought bug spray. They also had a lot of food. It wasn't until they were in the woods that Thomas noticed something. He had forgotten to pack a rope.

The woods were full of bears. Bears can smell food from very far away. Rope is used to tie the food to a tree. This stops the bears from eating it. "Don't worry," said Thomas. "There probably aren't any bears here anyway." Then the boys went to sleep. When they awoke, all their food was gone. There were giant paw prints all around their tents.
