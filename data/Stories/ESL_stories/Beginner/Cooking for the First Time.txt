Sam never knew how to cook. She was going to be living by herself. She decided it was time to learn. She bought books on how to cook. She also watched videos online. She decided to start simple. The first thing she decided to learn was pasta.

The first thing she did was to boil hot water to cook the pasta. She then made the sauce for fresh tomatoes. She added pepper and chillies to add more flavor. She also added cheese. After it was done, she ate it. She was excited to eat what she made. It did not taste that good. It was not horrible though. She decided that she needed more practice.
