Ms. Jackson's car broke down. She took it to the car shop. It had to stay there for one week. Ms. Jackson needed a car. She had to get to work somehow.

"You can take the bus," said her friend. Ms. Jackson had never taken the bus. She was scared of it. She thought she would get lost. "I've even heard of people getting robbed on buses," she said. "You'll be fine," said her friend.

Ms. Jackson got on the bus. It was not very scary. She was actually very relaxed. She ended up falling asleep. She missed her stop and was late to work.
