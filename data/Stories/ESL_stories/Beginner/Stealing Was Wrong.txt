Cory was poor. His parents had recently divorced. He lived with his dad. His dad only made $9 an hour. Cory had four other siblings. Rent was expensive. Electricity was expensive. Water was expensive. Everything was expensive. Cory was so hungry. He decided to steal. He knew it was bad, but he was poor.

He saw a delicious-looking apple. He looked around him. No one was looking at him. It was safe to steal. He put the apple in his pocket. He walked towards the store's exit. A moment later, he walked back to the apple section. He put the apple back. He did not want to be a bad person. Stealing was wrong.
