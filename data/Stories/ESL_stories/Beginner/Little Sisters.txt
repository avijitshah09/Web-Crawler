Linda has a younger sister. Her name is Ruth. Linda is usually annoyed by Ruth. She tries to get away from her. Ruth follows her like a lost puppy. Linda is used to that by now.

Ruth always looks up to Linda. She tries to do everything that Linda does. One day, Linda was getting ready to go out with friends. Linda didn't notice that Ruth was watching her when she was putting on her makeup.

When Linda got home, Ruth was waiting for her in her room. Her face was covered with permanent markers. "What did you do?" shouted Linda. "I painted my face like you," answered Ruth.
