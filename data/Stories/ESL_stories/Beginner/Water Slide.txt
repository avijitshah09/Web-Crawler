The kids are at a water park for a field trip. It is time to go on the water slide. Hector is scared to go on the slide. He looks up and sees how high the slide is. Afraid of heights, he does not want to go on. He sees all the other kids having fun on the slide. Hector gets very upset. The teacher goes up to talk to him. She explains to him that it is safe and nothing will happen. Hector decides to take the risk. He climbs up the slide. He takes a pause before he goes down. As he goes down, he screams. At the bottom he realizes it is not so bad. He is now ready to line up and go again.
