Deborah did a lot of push-ups yesterday. She usually never did any at all! When she woke up the next day, her arms were sore. She was confused at first. She did not hit herself. She wondered why her arms felt so weak. It hurt to move them. It really hurt when people touched her arm. Even a small poke would hurt her. She asked her dad to take her to the doctor. Her dad asked her if she exercised. She told him about the push-ups. "Now I see. After you exercise a lot, you get sore the next day," her dad said. "What can I do in order not to get sore?" Deborah asked. "Stretch!" her dad said.
