Lewis and his wife have two children. One is a boy named Eddie. Eddie is 25 years old, married, and has a baby. Their other child is a girl named Mary. Mary just turned 20. She moved out of her parent's house two weeks ago.

Their children are finally all grown up. Lewis and his wife finally have the house to themselves. They thought that they would enjoy living alone. "We can finally relax!" said Lewis. He missed having a quiet house. His wife was not happy. The house was completely silent now. It made her feel lonely. She missed her children.

"I know," said Lewis. "We can get a pet!" They went to the pet store and came back with three loud puppies. His wife was happy again, but Lewis was not.
