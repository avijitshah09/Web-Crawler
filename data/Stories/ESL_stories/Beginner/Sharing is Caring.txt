It was snack time. Ted has a bag of chips for his snack. Todd has an apple for his snack. Julia has a granola bar for her snack. Lauren has grapes for her snack. Todd doesn't really like his snack. He would rather have chips or a granola bar or grapes. He asks Ted, Julia, and Lauren if they are willing to trade. They say no. The teacher hears this. She says it's not very nice to say no. She tells them to share. Ted grabs a handful of chips. Julia tears off a piece of her granola bar. Lauren breaks off a branch of grapes. Todd takes the food. He thanks his friends.
