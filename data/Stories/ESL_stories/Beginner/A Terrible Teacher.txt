Ms. Robins was known around the school as the meanest teacher ever. She gave hard tests, made fun of students, and wouldn't let the students have any fun whatsoever. Why was Ms. Robins so terrible? Well, she never wanted to be a teacher. She grew up wanting to be an actress. She was pretty good at it. She even had her own TV show once. The TV show did not do so well, and it ended after a year. Ms. Robins struggled to find a job after that.

Ms. Robins only got her job as a teacher because she knew the principal of the school. They were best friends from high school. Ms. Robins taught history. Her students were all afraid of her. One of the students, Cassidy, raised her hand to ask a question. "Ms. Robins, how long should our essay be?" Ms. Robins stared at her coldly and said, "I hate repeating myself. Ask your classmate."

Ms. Robins was called into the principal's office. "What's up?" she asked. "There have been some concerns over your behavior," the principal said. "I know where this is going," Ms. Robins said. "Do you? Well, it has to change. I know you don't want to be here, but you can't get paid if all your students want you gone," the principal said. Ms. Robins was more careful since her meeting with the principal.
