In order to raise money for a field trip, the school was having a chocolate sale. They had all the kids sell chocolate to raise money. If they did not sell chocolate, they would have to pay for the field trip themselves or not go. They had various types of chocolates. There were caramel, milk chocolate, dark, and waffle. Each chocolate cost one dollar. There were also prizes for the kids who sold the most chocolate. The top seller would win a bike. All the kids were excited to sell chocolate. The most chocolate sold last year was 30 boxes. Everyone hoped to beat the record this year.
