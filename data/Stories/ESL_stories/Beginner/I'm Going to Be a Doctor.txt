Chris Williams had planned his future. He was going to become a doctor. Chris studied hard for four years. Then, he got accepted into a medical school. He studied there two more years. He took hard science and math classes. Chris was the best student. "You're going to make an excellent doctor!" his professors told him.

One day, Chris was in class. He had to learn to draw blood. He stared at the needles. "It's your turn to try it, Chris," said the professor. Chris couldn't move. He had no idea why he felt so scared. Shaking, he injected the patient's arm. A little drop of blood came out. Chris fainted. Doctors cannot be scared of blood. It was time to find a new career.
