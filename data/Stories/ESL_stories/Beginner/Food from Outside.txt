Vicky works at Eleven Men, a cafe that serves coffee and pastries. She does not really like her job, but it gets the bills paid. One of the rules at the cafe is not to bring food from other restaurants into the cafe. Vicky greeted one of the customers. She noticed that the customer had something from Panda Express. However, Vicky didn't say anything because she didn't think it was a big deal.

Vicky's boss, Angelica, called her over. "Vicky, you need to tell her about our rule about food from other places," she said. Vicky nodded and went over to the customer. "Hi, I'm sorry, but you cannot have food from other restaurants here," Vicky said. "But it's not like I'm not ordering from you guys. I just want something to drink with my meal," the customer said. "You can come in after you finish your food. I'm sorry, I don't make the rules," Vicky said.

The customer was furious. He got up and knocked the table and chairs down. "This is a terrible cafe!" he said. All the other customers and employees stared at him. The angry customer left and wrote an angry review on the cafe. The owners of Eleven Men decided to change the rule so that people could bring in food from other places if they still buy something from them.
