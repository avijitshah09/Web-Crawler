George and his friends went to the park. They first went on the swings. Everyone stared at them. They are already in college. They wanted to feel young again. A parent tapped George on the shoulder. It was a mother. She asked George to get off. George asked, "Why?" "Because my little girl wants to go on," she replied.

George turned to the side. There was a young girl. She was about 10 years old. George felt bad. He got off the swing. "Here you go, kid." George said. His friends laughed at him. George went on the slide. He felt young on the slide.
