Donald Campbell needed to go to New York. He lived in Los Angeles. Driving there would take three days. His only other option was to take an airplane. That would take around six hours.

Donald was afraid of airplanes. He had never been on one. "That's a dumb fear," said his friend. "Cars are more dangerous than airplanes." Donald was sure this was a lie. He didn't trust something so big in the air.

Donald ignored his friend. He was going to drive for three days. Halfway through the trip, Donald got very sleepy. He was on a highway. He crashed into a giant trailer.
