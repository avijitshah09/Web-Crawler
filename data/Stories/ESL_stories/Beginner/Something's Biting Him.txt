Joe went to the doctor. He had red bites all over his body. He had red bites on his face. He had red bites on his chest. He had red bites on his back. He had red bites on his legs. But he didn't have red bites on his feet or hands. "Why don't you have red bites on your feet? Why don't you have red bites on your hands?" Dr. Brown asked. "I don't know. I am the patient. You are the doctor. Why do I have red bites all over my body?" asked Joe. Dr. Brown said Joe had fleas. "You have fleas," Dr. Brown said. "Do you have a dog?" Joe said he didn't have a dog. "Then get a dog," said Dr. Brown. "Why should I get a dog?" Joe asked. "Because then the fleas will bite the dog instead of you," said Dr. Brown.
