The Wright family loves fishing. They head to a nearby lake every weekend. They used to catch a lot of fish. Now, they are lucky to end up with two fish altogether. There are other differences at the lake. The water used to be crystal blue. Recently, it started looking a lot greener. It even smells a bit nasty. Mr. Wright is getting worried about it.

There is a factory about a mile away from the lake. Mrs. Wright suspects they are responsible for the changes. "They're probably dumping their waste in the water," she says. "That's probably killing all the fish." They probably won't eat the fish they catch there anymore.
