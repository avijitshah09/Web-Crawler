Pat and Angel are twins. They like different things though. Pat likes salty food. Angel likes sweet food. Pat likes chips, pizza, and burgers. Angel likes cake, ice cream, and strawberries. Their parents wanted to buy them a meal for their birthday. The problem was that they wanted different things. Pat wanted to eat salty fish. Angel wanted to eat a cake. "Why can't we get both things?" Pat asked. "We are having money problems," her mom said. "Let's get the fish," Angel said. Her parents were impressed by her maturity. Pat thanked her twin.
