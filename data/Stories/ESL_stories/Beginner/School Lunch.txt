All the kids hated school lunch. It was disgusting. Sometimes they had mystery meat. Today in particular they had hot dogs. The hot dog has a strange color. The bun was also hard and stale. The lunch was free. Most kids did not complain. It was not healthy though. The students decided to form a petition. They wanted healthier and fresher food. They gathered a lot of signatures. The school decided to listen to them. They added new items to their menu. They had salad and also yogurt. They took out the hot dogs and hamburgers. The kids rejoiced. The food was finally edible.
