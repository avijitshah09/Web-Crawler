Today was the day for the food drive. They were collecting food cans at school. All new and unexpired cans were accepted. The cans would be delivered to the homeless. The more cans they collected, the better. Sarah brought 10 cans. Tom brought 5 cans. Sam brought 13 cans. Everyone else also brought cans. In total the school collected 500 cans. The food drive was a success. Everyone was happy to help out. Everyone helped load the cans into the truck. They also delivered the cans. The food drive was so successful that they decided to do one every month.
