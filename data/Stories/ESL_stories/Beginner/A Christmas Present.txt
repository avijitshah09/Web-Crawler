"What do you want for Christmas?" Daddy asked Anthony. Anthony wanted a little brother. "Can I have a little brother for Christmas?" Anthony asked. "Well, I'll have to talk to your mother," said Daddy. "Why do you have to talk to Mommy?" Anthony asked. "Who's going to change the diapers?" Daddy asked. "You're right, Daddy. We need Mommy to change the diapers." Mommy walked into the room. Anthony told Mommy that he wanted a little brother for Christmas. Mommy said, "Well, I'll have to talk to your father." "Why do you have to talk to Daddy?" Anthony asked. "Who's going to pay the doctor?" asked Mommy. "You're right, Mommy. We need Daddy to pay the doctor." Mommy and Daddy walked out of the room. A little later, they came back into the room. Mommy said, "You can't have a little brother for Christmas. But if you can wait, you can have a little brother in April."
