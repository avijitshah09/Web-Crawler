Abby's mom gave her a credit card. The credit card is supposed to be for emergencies. Abby went to the mall with her friends. She saw a pretty purse. It was black and shiny. She had to have it. She went inside the store. She looked at the price tag. The purse was $600. She really wanted it. She looked at her credit card. She went up to the cashier. She handed the worker her credit card. He swiped it. She didn't realize that she had to pay for the purse later. The purse showed up on the bill a month later.
