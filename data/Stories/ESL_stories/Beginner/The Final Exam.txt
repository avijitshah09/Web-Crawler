Most students have to take a final exam. It is the most important exam. It makes up most of your grade. It can raise your grade a lot or drop it. It is usually long. It is usually cumulative, which means that it includes information from the beginning of the class. This means you have to remember everything. You should study a lot for it. The test might be multiple choice. The test might be an essay. The test might be fill in the blank. Remember to get good rest. Also, eat a healthy breakfast. Nothing with too much sugar. Eat something like a fruit salad. Don't eat pancakes with syrup. Good luck!
