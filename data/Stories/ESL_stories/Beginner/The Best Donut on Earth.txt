Ginny was obsessed with donuts. She had her first donut when she was five years old. It was from a gas station. Ginny was crying, and her dad was trying to get her to be quiet. He gave her a donut, and Ginny immediately stopped crying.

Ginny has tried twenty different donut shops and hundreds of different flavors. Some of her favorite donut flavors included chocolate, banana, and regular glazed. Her friend, Rebecca, knows how much she likes donuts, so she recommended her a place. "It's called Dough Nutty. It's known to be the best donut on earth!" Rebecca said. "What's so good about it?" Ginny asked. "They're really fresh, and they use a type of sugar that is good for you!" Rebecca said. Ginny was going to check the shop out.

Dough Nutty was an hour away from Ginny's house. Her brother made fun of her for driving so far just to eat donuts. When Ginny and Rebecca got there, the store was closed! The girls felt so frustrated. They decided to get donuts at the gas station nearby. It was not the best, but it was still pretty good.
