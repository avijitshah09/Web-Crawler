Jason Hernandez was driving on the freeway. He was in a rush to get home. He needed to watch the Baseball final. Suddenly, he saw flashing red lights behind him, and then a siren sounded. A policeman pulled him over to the side.

Jason was terrified. He had never gotten a ticket before. The policeman came to his window, and asked him if he knew he had been speeding. Jason couldn't speak. He wanted to reply, "Yes sir, I apologize." However, as soon as he opened his mouth, Jason started sobbing.

The policeman was surprised. He hadn't seen a thirty-year-old man cry like a three-year-old baby. After, chuckling a little bit, the police let Jason go with just a warning. It was his lucky day.
