Summer was a month away. That meant the local pool was going to open soon. All the kids were excited, but Evans was not.

Evans did not know how to swim. He signed up for swim lessons. He was very afraid of the deep water. "Evans," said his teacher. "You need to relax. Nothing will happen to you." Evans practiced every day.

When the pool finally opened, all the kids ran inside. Evans slowly walked to edge of the pool. The other kids laughed at him for being scared. Evans was embarrassed. To shut them up, he dove into the water from the high board. His swim lessons paid off.
