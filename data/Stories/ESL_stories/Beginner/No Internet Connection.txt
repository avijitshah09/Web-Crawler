Jacob had to write a ten-page paper on Abraham Lincoln by tomorrow. He hadn't even started yet. He always procrastinated, but he always got good grades, too. Jacob poured himself a cup of coffee and drank the whole thing. He opened up his laptop. Then, he opened up a blank document. Next, he opened up the Internet browser. He had to look up information on Abraham Lincoln.

When he clicked the "Enter" button to look up information, it said there was an Internet connection problem! He checked his router. It looked fine. He double checked if he typed "Abraham Lincoln" incorrectly. He tried turning his wi-fi on and off. It still didn't work. Jacob started to sweat. He knew his teacher wouldn't give him a deadline extension. Jacob called customer service and explained his problem.

The person on the other line gave him suggestions, but nothing worked. Jacob talked to the person for about an hour and then gave up. He was upset that he wasted an hour. It was already 9 p.m., and he had to turn in his paper at 8 a.m. Jacob had to turn this around. He went to the library, picked out ten books on Lincoln and used the library computer. He finished writing at 2:00 a.m. He ended up getting an A on the paper!
