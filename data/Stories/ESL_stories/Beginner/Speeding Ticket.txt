Brian Nelson was late for work. He had been stuck in traffic for half an hour. The cars were finally starting to move. Brian had to make it to work in ten minutes. If he was late, he would be in big trouble with his boss.

"There's no way I'll make it in time," said Brian. Suddenly, a car raced past him. Three second later, another car raced past him. They were going around 80 miles per hour. Brian knew that speeding was the only way he would make it to work on time. He looked around him. There were no cops in sight. He decided to push his speed up to 70. Two seconds later, he heard sirens behind him.
