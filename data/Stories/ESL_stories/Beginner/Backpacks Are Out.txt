Joanne had a blue backpack. She had it for a month. It was not that nice. It was popular last year. This year backpacks were out. All the popular girls had bags. The rich girls had designer bags. Only guys had backpacks now. Joanne still had a backpack though. A mean girl made fun of her. Joanne turned red. She felt so bad. She threw away her backpack at home. Her mom saw it in the trashcan. She asked Joanne what was wrong. Joanne explained what had happened. "You shouldn't throw it away. Be unique," her mom said. Joanne thought her mom was right. She got back the backpack.
