Lily was playing a computer game. Random people online are grouped in fives. They all play against each other. You can also talk to the other players. Lily noticed that someone had sent her a message. She clicked on the "inbox". It was from someone she did not know. The person said hi. It was a guy. She was deciding whether or not to reply. Her mom always said not to talk to strangers. But her dad said every friend was once a stranger. She said hi. The guy asked where she was from. She told him she was from Los Angeles. He was from there, too. They turned out to be from the same math class!
