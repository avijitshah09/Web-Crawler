Josh wanted to do something fun today. He decided to go to the art museum with his sister. Today was a special day. The museum was free. It was usually 20 dollars to enter per person. They packed lunch sandwiches to eat later. They drove there. It took about half an hour.

The first thing they looked at was Renaissance art. This was art from the 14th to 17th century. It was Josh's favorite. After that they went to look at modern art. His sister loved modern art. She loved how refreshing and abstract it was. They admired all the artwork. They took pictures of some of them.
