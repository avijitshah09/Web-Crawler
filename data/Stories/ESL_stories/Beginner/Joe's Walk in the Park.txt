It was a beautiful day. Joe went to the park. There were people everywhere. Joe saw many things. He saw a boy riding a bike. He saw a girl swinging on a swing. He saw a family having a picnic. He saw a man playing the guitar. It was a happy sight. Joe took a deep breath. The air was fresh. The smell of flowers was in the air. The trees were swaying in the wind. Joe felt so alive. Joe heard a bell. He looked around and saw the ice-cream man. He reached in his pockets. He grabbed three dollars. "Hey, ice-cream man!" Joe yelled. The ice-cream man stopped and turned around. He walked towards Joe. "One ice-cream, please," Joe said. The ice-cream man handed Joe an ice-cream bar. "Thank you," said the ice-cream man. Joe paid and went on his way. It was a sunny day. Everything was perfect.
