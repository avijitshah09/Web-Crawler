Kelly Moore and her friends went to the beach. Kelly did not know how to swim. All her friends were having fun in the water.

"Come in!" they kept shouting. "Stop being a chicken!" she heard them say. Kelly hated being teased. She finally decided to jump into the water. Right after she went in, a big wave struck them. Kelly panicked. She couldn't fight the strong water. When she finally surfaced, she couldn't see any of her friends. The wave had pulled her away.

Luckily, a surfer spotted her. He took her back to shore. The only bright side to her day was that the surfer had a great body.
