Paul hated sports. He was very bad at them, too. Yet, suddenly, he started practicing for football and basketball try-outs. "Why are you doing this?" asked Robert. "I need to be more active," replied Paul.

Robert didn't believe Paul. Still, he wanted to support his friend. Robert went with Paul to the try-outs. That was when Robert figured out why Paul suddenly cared about sports. Paul kept looking over to the cheerleaders. His crush, Susan, had just joined the squad.

Paul was the worst player at try-outs. He got tackled very hard in football. Then, he got hit in the head by the basketball. He had no chance of making the team.
