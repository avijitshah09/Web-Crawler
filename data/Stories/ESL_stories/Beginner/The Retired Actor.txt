Mr. Moore was retired. He used to be an actor. He was very loved and famous. Everywhere he went, women would stop him. They used to want to hug him and take pictures. He was a very handsome man. It was rare to ever see him by himself.

Now, Mr. Moore was almost always alone. Many years had passed since his acting days. He had aged a lot. Sometimes, he walked around Hollywood boulevard. He hoped someone would recognize him. No one ever did. He was no longer handsome. His good looks were now covered with wrinkles. He wished he could be young again.
