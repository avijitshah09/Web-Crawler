She took a bagel out of the package. She took a knife out of the drawer. She sliced the bagel in half. She sliced it carefully, because a bagel is hard to cut. If the knife slipped, she might cut her finger. She put each half of the bagel into the toaster. She pushed the toaster handle down. One minute later, both bagel slices popped up. She buttered each slice. Then she put the slices into the microwave. She microwaved the slices for 15 seconds. She waited a few seconds for the slices to cool down. Then she bit into a slice. It was hot and chewy. It was delicious. She dipped it into her coffee. She took another bite. Now it was wet and chewy.
