Beatrice rode her bike everywhere. Most of her classmates drove around the neighborhood. Beatrice's family couldn't afford to get her a car, so she decided to take her driving test later. She doesn't mind too much. Biking was fun and it was good exercise.

On her way home from school, Beatrice stopped by the supermarket. She forgot her bike lock. She thought about what to do, and decided to just leave the bike outside. No one was going to steal her bike, she thought. She went inside to buy milk. When she exited the store, her bike was gone! She was going crazy. She looked all around the market just to see if the thief was still nearby. Hours went by, and she still couldn't find it.

Beatrice walked back home with the gallon of milk in her hand. She looked up and her bike was in front of her house. She was surprised. How did it end up at home? She asked her family how it got there. It turned out that her brother took it as a prank.
