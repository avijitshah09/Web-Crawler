The plane was waiting to take off. The plane was in line on the runway. One plane was ahead of it. Many planes were behind it. Everyone wanted to get up into the air. Everyone was tired of sitting on the ground. Planes are for flying, not sitting. Planes are like birds. Birds are for flying, not sitting. A man stood up. The flight attendant told him to sit down. The man ran to the bathroom. He locked the bathroom door. The flight attendant knocked on the door. She knocked and knocked. The man didn't come out. The flight attendant told the captain. The captain went back to the bathroom. He knocked on the bathroom door. The man didn't come out. He said, "Leave me alone! I want to be alone!" The captain took the plane back to the airport. Everyone was angry at the man in the bathroom.
