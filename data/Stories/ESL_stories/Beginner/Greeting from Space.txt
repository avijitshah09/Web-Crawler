Wilson had always wanted to be an astronaut. His kindergarten teacher had told him that was impossible. "That's nice," she said. "But you'll probably never make it." Wilson thought she was very mean. Still, he never gave up his dream.

Twenty years later, Wilson proved her wrong. He was on space mission to the moon. While looking down on Earth, Wilson thought of his old teacher. He wished she could see him now. He grabbed his camera and took a picture of himself in his spacesuit. A million stars were in the background. As soon as he landed back on Earth he ran to the post office. He mailed the picture to the mean teacher.
