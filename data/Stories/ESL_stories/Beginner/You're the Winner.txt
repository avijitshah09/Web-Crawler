Liz Adams had spent all day glued to her radio. Her favorite band was playing a show soon. A station was giving away free tickets. Liz was determined to win a pair. From six in the morning till midnight, Liz listened to the station non-stop. This went on for four days.

Liz had to be caller 20 to win. On the last day of the contest, she finally got through. "You're the winner!" said the radio host. Liz screamed with excitement. She also jumped uncontrollably. Her cell phone slipped from her hand. It landed in a big puddle. "Hello?" asked the radio host. "Oh well," he said. "I guess she didn't want the tickets."
