Harris had just turned 75 years old. He was feeling so ancient. He wanted his youth back. He used to be strong and handsome. Now he was wrinkly and flabby. He used to love adventure. He even wrestled an alligator once. Now, he was too lazy to even go for walks. "Time passed by too fast!" he kept thinking. I need to be more daring.

Harris knew what to do. "I'm going to go skydiving!" he said. He picked up his grandson. "We're going on an adventure!" he told him. By the time they got to the airport, Harris was asleep. "Forget it," said Harris. "It's nap time."
