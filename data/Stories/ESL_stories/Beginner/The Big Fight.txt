Mr. and Mrs. King had a teenage daughter named Michelle. They were always arguing with her. Michelle was a good daughter. However, her parents were very strict.

One evening, Michelle wanted to go out. Her parents weren't letting her go. "Your room isn't clean enough!" shouted Mrs. King. Michelle decided to sneak out. Her parents did not know where she was going.

The next morning, Mrs. King went to Michelle's room. She wanted to apologize for being so hard on her. Michelle was nowhere to be found. Since they did not get to ask where she was going, they did not know where to look. They never saw Michelle again.
