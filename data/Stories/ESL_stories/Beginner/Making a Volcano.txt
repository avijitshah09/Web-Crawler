Science Fair was coming up. Julio had to come up with a project. He was working by himself this year. He wanted the challenge of doing it all by himself. While searching the web, he came across the idea of building a volcano. He decided that a volcano would be the way to win the science fair. He asked his parents to take him to the grocery store to buy supplies to make the volcano. After working several hours on the volcano, he decided to test it out. He turned it on and watched the lava spew out. It was amazing. He was so proud of himself. The next day he took his project to school for the science fair.
