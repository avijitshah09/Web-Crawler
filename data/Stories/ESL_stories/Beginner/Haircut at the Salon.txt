His hair was long. It was getting too long. It bothered him sometimes. The hair would get in his mouth. It would get on his food. It sometimes made him itchy. He thought about cutting it. He asked his friends. His friends told him not to. He asked them why. His friends said he looked fine. He did not care what his friends said. He decided to get a haircut. It was the middle of the day. He was not doing anything. He went to the salon. He walked in and sat down. He waited for the hair stylist. She was with another customer. She finished shortly. She greeted him. She cut his hair. It took twenty minutes. He looked in the mirror. He looked good. He was glad he got a haircut. He paid and thanked the hair stylist. He went on his way.
