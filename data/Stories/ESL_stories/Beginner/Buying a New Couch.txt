The Johnson's couch was very old. They had already had it in the family for over 20 years. The couch had stains from their lunches and dinners. It was ripped by their cat. The couch also had a strange odor coming from it. It was time for a new one.

They went to a furniture store. They saw all types of couches. They saw long ones, short ones, leather ones, and fabric ones. They all decided to pick a black leather couch that could seat four people. They had the couch delivered to their house. The Johnsons were very happy. The whole family sat on their new couch and watched TV together.
