Andrew Smith was starting a band. He was a great guitar player. His brother played the drums very well. His friend was a good bassist. All they needed now was a singer. Andrew was going to hold auditions to find one.

Andrew made posters. They read, "Looking for great singers". He handed them out around town. Many people showed up to audition. A lot of them sounded very good. Andrew's favorite was a beautiful girl. "She sounds terrible!" said all his band mates. "You guys are crazy," Andrew replied. He thought she was perfect. "Love is making you deaf!" said Andrew's brother.
