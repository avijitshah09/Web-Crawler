Steven had just moved to California. He had so many things to see and do. He wanted to go camping by the beach. He wanted to visit Hollywood. But above everything, he wanted to go to Disneyland.

Steven drove to Anaheim the first chance he got. He had been dreaming of seeing Disneyland since he was five years old. He was now twenty-five. As soon as Steven walked into the park, he turned into a five-year-old again. He was so full of excitement that he cried. Steven went back to Disneyland at least once every month. He loved his new home.
