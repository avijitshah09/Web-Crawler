Daniel had to do a project for school. He had to compare two variables. He chose to do soda and water. He wanted to find out if water or soda was better for plants. In order to do this, he had to water the plants every hour. He recorded the height of the plants. At the end of two weeks, he would compare the heights of the plants. He concluded that water was better for plants. He had to make a report for his findings. He printed out a chart and pictures of his project. He was fascinated with his discovery. He initially thought soda would be better since it had sugar in it.
