Adrian Gonzalez was very tall. He also had huge muscles. It was clear he was a big strong man. However, this big strong man had a big fear. He was scared of the dentist.

He had avoided the dentist for ten years. Adrian wanted to keep avoiding it for the rest of his life. Unfortunately, his wisdom teeth were killing him. Adrian's wife was tired of hearing him complaining. "That's it!" she said. "You're facing your fear tomorrow!"

It took 20 minutes to get Adrian to sit on the dentist chair. However, Adrian doesn't remember anything after that. He had slept through his entire appointment. He then pretended not to remember crying the whole way to the clinic.
