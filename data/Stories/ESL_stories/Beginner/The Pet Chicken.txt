Andrew Williams got a new pet. It was a baby chick. His parents brought it home one day. At first, Andrew did not like the chick. He wanted a different pet. "All of my friends have dogs or cats," he complained. The chick followed Andrew everywhere. She was very cute. After two months, Andrew grew very close to her. He named her Rex.

Andrew got home from school one day. He started looking for Rex. He couldn't find her anywhere. "Rex ran away from home," said Andrew's mom. Andrew was confused. Then, he looked at the oven. His mom was cooking a chicken for dinner. Andrew cried.
