Elizabeth Parker wanted a promotion. She had been working in her company for three years. "It's about time I get a raise," she thought. "I sure deserve it". She did deserve it. She was the hardest worker in the company. Her manager was now looking for a new assistant manager. Elizabeth was sure she would be picked.

A month before this, a new man had been hired. He was very handsome, but also very lazy. Elizabeth's manager was clearly attracted to him. She was so attracted to him that she gave him the promotion. Elizabeth was shocked. She quit that day.
