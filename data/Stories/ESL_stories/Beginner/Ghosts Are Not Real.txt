Thomas looked like a tough guy. "Nothing can scare me," he always said. "Not even a ghost?" asked his friend. "Of course not," said Thomas. "Ghosts aren't even real."

The next day, Thomas and his friends were bored. They went to explore the neighborhood. They ran into an old abandoned house. They dared Thomas to go inside. He had to stay there for five minutes.

Thomas was very brave at first. He couldn't see anything in the dark. Suddenly he started hearing things. It sounded like a woman screaming. Thomas ran out of the house crying.
