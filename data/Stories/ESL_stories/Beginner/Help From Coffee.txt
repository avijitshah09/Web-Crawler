Amy needed to stay awake for 24 hours. It was easy at first. She did what she usually does. She went to school. She went to piano practice. She did her homework. She did her chores. She spent time with friends. It started getting hard at midnight. Her parents were sleeping. Her friends were sleeping, too. She didn't know what to do. She turned on the T.V. There was nothing interesting. She read more of her textbook. That was making her more sleepy. Amy was getting desperate. She went to the kitchen. She made herself coffee. She drank three cups. She was now wide awake.
