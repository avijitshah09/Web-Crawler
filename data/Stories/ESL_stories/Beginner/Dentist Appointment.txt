Amy had a dentist appointment. It was time for her check-up. The dentist would see if she had any cavities. She arrived at the dentist, and signed in. They called her name. An assistant took x-rays of her teeth. The assistant then told her to wait in the waiting room. After ten minutes the dentist called her in. She told Amy that she had no cavities. They just had to clean her teeth.

The dentist used special tools. Even a special toothbrush was used. It was not like the regular kind that Amy used at home. After the dentist was done, Amy felt good. Her teeth felt shiny and clean. She would come back six months later.
