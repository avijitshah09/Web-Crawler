Sol and Victor decided to go hiking. Today was a perfect day for hiking. The weather was a cool 70 degrees. The hike was 3 miles up and 3 miles down. They brought plenty of water for their hike. Sol brought his dog on the hike also.

They hiked upwards. At the top there was a waterfall. They admired the view. It was beautiful. When they were done, they hiked back down. After the hike Sol and Victor were tired. They decided to get a healthy fruit smoothie. They went back to Victor's house and made smoothies.
