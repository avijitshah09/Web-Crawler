Stephanie left her keys in the car. She has another set of keys at home. She called her brother. "Hey, are you busy?" she asked. "Yes, I'm watching TV," he said. "Well, too bad. I need you to drive to my school," she said. He complained. He didn't want to get up. The movie he was watching was good.

"Please. I'll clean your room for a week," she offered. "Deal! I'll be there!" her brother said. Stephanie waited. Her brother arrived. He came in his white truck. He gave her the keys. Stephanie opened the car door. The siblings drove back home.
