Donna's birthday was coming up. Her friends asked her what she wanted. Donna said to get her nothing. She did not want to owe them anything. Her parents asked her what she wanted. Donna told them not to get her anything. "Are you sure?" her mom asked. Donna said yes.

Donna's parents and friends did not believe her. They thought she was just being modest. They got her presents anyways. Donna's mom gave her a diamond bracelet. Her dad gave her flowers. Her friends threw her a surprise party. Donna said thank you. Donna was a little disappointed though. She did not have much fun at her surprise party.
