Bill was playing catch with his friends inside his house. His parents were not home. They were playing with a baseball. They played for a little bit until Bill missed the ball. The ball hit a crystal vase and broke it. It was a gift his parents got for their wedding. It was very special to his mom. Bill knew he got in big trouble. His friends tried to help him. They tried to glue it back together. It didn't work. They searched the Internet to see if they could find another one and replace it. Bill decided that the only thing he could do was to tell his parents. His parents came home. Bill told them. His mother was furious. She told him not to play with the ball inside the house.
