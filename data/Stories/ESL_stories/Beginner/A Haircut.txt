She has very long hair. It reaches her waist. She goes to the hair salon. She waits. She reads a magazine. The barber calls her name. She sits down. She says she wants her hair to be short. The barber cuts twelve inches off. The barber asks if she likes her haircut. She looks in the mirror. She likes it.
