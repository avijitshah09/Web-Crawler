Martin and Kylie have been in a relationship for four years. They have already said "I loved you," met each other's parents, and talked about marriage. Their friends and family are just waiting for Martin to propose to Kylie. However, they don't know that Martin has been having second thoughts about his relationship with Kylie.

Martin asked Kylie to go out to dinner with him. "So, this is going to be hard to hear," Martin said. "What happened? Did someone die?" Kylie asked. Kylie had no idea what was coming next. "I want to take a break from us," Martin said. "What do you mean?!" Kylie asked. "I still love you. I just need some time to myself. I want to travel by myself," Martin said. "For how long?" Kylie asked. "Maybe a year," Martin said. "I'm not going to wait around, so we're over," Kylie said.

Martin was sad at first, but as he was traveling across the world, he didn't feel too sad anymore. He first went up to Canada. He really liked the donuts there. He then went to Ireland. He really liked how green it was. He then went to Italy. He really liked the buildings and houses there. Next, he went to Vietnam. He really liked the people there. After one year, he came back to the United States. He asked how Kylie was doing. They went out again to catch up. They got back together. It was clear that they still loved each other.
