Carrie has too many clothes. She does not have room for anything anymore. Her friends tell her to donate them. Carrie thinks that is a bad idea. She thinks it is a waste of money. She wants to sell her clothes. Her friends tell her that is a bad idea. They think that no one will want to buy her clothes. They say her clothes are not in style anymore.

Carrie ignored them. She took pictures of her clothes. She posted them on a website. Two weeks passed by. Her friends were right. No one wanted to buy her clothes. Carrie decided to donate them.
