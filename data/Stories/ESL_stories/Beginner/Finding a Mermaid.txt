Clark took his six-year-old son sailing. It was James' first time on the ocean. They were having a great time. They were finding a bunch of sea creatures. James was amazed. First, Clark spotted five dolphins. Then, James spotted a big whale. They even touched a sea lion.

"Look!" called out Clark. He pointed to something swimming in the distance. "Do you know what that is?" he asked his son. "A mermaid!" shouted James, "A real mermaid!" Clark fell to ground laughing. James was confused. He did not understand what was so funny. "That's not a mermaid!" explained Clark. "That's called a manatee. Their nickname is â€˜sea-cows'."
