Paul was getting braces. He was turning thirteen. His parents decided it was now a good time to get braces. Paul had an overbite. He also had very crooked teeth. Braces were expensive. He had to do it though. He scheduled an appointment for tomorrow. He was scared. He thought it would hurt.

The orthodontist looked at his teeth. He took several pictures and x-rays. He told Paul that he would start to put the braces on. Paul was scared. However, it did not hurt as much as he thought. After the orthodontist was done, Paul was relieved. He felt weird to have metal things on his teeth though. He had trouble eating. His parents bought him ice cream.
