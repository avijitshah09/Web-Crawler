Brian didn't have cable TV. He didn't have satellite TV. He had an antenna for his TV. He had an indoor antenna. But it was an old antenna. The reception was bad. He needed to buy a new antenna. He went to Best Buy. The antennas were in boxes. He looked at the boxes. Which antenna was the best? He asked a clerk at Best Buy. "Which antenna is the best?" he asked the clerk. The clerk said, "This is the best antenna." He showed Brian the box. Brian asked the price. "What is the price?" he asked. The clerk said the price was $50. Brian took the antenna home. He plugged one end of the antenna into his TV. He plugged the other end of the antenna into the wall socket. He turned on his TV. The reception was bad. He returned the antenna.
