Ed Kane was a teacher at Middlebury High School. He taught math. He was known as the "Mystery Man." No one knows anything about him or his life. Ed wants to keep it that way. He didn't want to be a teacher. He wanted to be an astronaut, but things didn't work out that way. He came to Middlebury to teach, not to get to know the students.

Even though he wasn't the happiest or friendliest teacher, Ed was always willing to help out his students if they needed help, but if they asked about his personal life, he would turn them away. One of the troublemakers in the class, Matt, asked Ed what his plans for the weekend were. "I don't know," Ed said. "Mr. Kane, tell us something about yourself," Matt asked. "That's enough, Matt!" Ed said.

It wasn't that Ed was embarrassed by his lifestyle, but rather, Ed just thought that students should focus on math. If he got too friendly with them, they might think of him as an "easy" teacher. Ed was married, with two kids and one guinea pig. Ed's hobbies included golfing and swimming. Ed was a very intelligent man and only had two close friends.
