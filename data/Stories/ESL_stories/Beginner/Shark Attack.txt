Martin is a long distance ocean swimmer. He practices every morning in Hermosa Beach. One morning he ran into a great white shark. He only saw it for one second. Then it quickly bit his ribs. Martin was carried to shore by his friends. He lost a lot of blood. Luckily, Martin somehow survived. None of his organs were taken.

As soon as he healed, Martin went back to swimming in the ocean. He was not scared of sharks. "Getting attacked by shark is rare," says Martin. "The ocean is their home. People are just guest. Plus, I probably just scared this shark."
