Mr. and Mrs. Green were new parents. Their baby was born two months before. For two months, they hadn't gotten any sleep. The baby took up every minute of their days. They needed a break from parenting. "We're going to go crazy," said Mr. Green.

Mr. Green's mom told them to go on vacation. She would take care of their baby while they were gone. "That sounds like a great plan!" said Mrs. Green. The couple packed up their bags and were on their way quickly.

The new parents thought they would love their first time away from the baby. They were very wrong. All they could do was worry about whether he was okay. They drove back home after one day.
