"Rex is very sick," Lucy's mom said. "Is he going to die?" Lucy asked. "Yes, I'm afraid so," mom said. "I'm going to take him to the vet." Lucy wanted to go along. "Okay, but try not to cry, okay?" mom asked. Lucy said she wouldn't cry. Mom carried Rex out to the car. She put him in the back seat. He was a little dog. He was 12 years old. He was the same age as Lucy. They drove to the vet. The vet looked at Rex. He said he could not do anything for Rex. "Rex is on his last legs," the vet said. He told mom she could take Rex home and wait for him to die. Or the vet could simply put Rex to sleep. "Let's put him to sleep," Lucy said. "That way he won't suffer." Mom said that was a good idea. They left Rex with the vet. "We can get another dog for you if you want," mom told Lucy on the way home. "Can we get a kitten instead?" Lucy asked.
