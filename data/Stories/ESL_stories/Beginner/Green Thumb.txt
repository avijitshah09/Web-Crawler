Sarah loved plants. She loved growing new things in her garden. She liked to grow her own fruits and vegetables. She thought they were more organic that way. They would also be more satisfying to eat. This time she was growing mangoes. She knew her mango tree would take a while to grow.

She bought a small mango tree from the store. She then got all her gardening tools. She made sure to wear a hat and sunscreen since it was hot outside. She dug a hole. She then placed the tree inside. She made sure it got plenty of light and water. She awaited her tasty mangoes.
