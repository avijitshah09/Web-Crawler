It was that time of the year. The time of the year for girl scout cookies. Everyone loved girl scout cookies. They were delicious, and they also went to a good cause. All the girl scouts had to sell cookies. The girl who sold the most cookies usually got a prize. There were several different types of cookies. They were all the same price. Different people had different tastes. They had cookies for everyone. A lot of girl scout cookies were sold at school. Some sold in front of markets. Others sold in malls. Some even went door to door to sell cookies. Although it was fun to sell cookies, it was also a lot of work.
