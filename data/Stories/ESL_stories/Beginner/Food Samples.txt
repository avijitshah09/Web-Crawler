Rosie went to the supermarket. She wanted to buy milk, cereal, and chicken. She took a shopping cart. She went to the meat aisle. She grabbed a pack of chicken, and put it inside the shopping cart. She went to the dairy aisle. She grabbed a gallon of milk, and put it inside the shopping cart. She went to the cereal aisle. She grabbed a box of sweet cereal, and put it inside the shopping cart.

She saw a long line of people. She was curious what they were lining up for. She looked at the front of the line. They were giving out samples of pizza! Samples are free. There is always a line for samples. Rosie decided to stand in line, too.
