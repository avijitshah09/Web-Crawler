Jimmy wanted to cross the street. He was on the south side of the street. He wanted to get to the north side of the street. He was in the middle of the block. His father always told him to cross at an intersection. His father always said never cross in the middle of the block. Jimmy walked to the intersection. There was a traffic light at the intersection. It had three colors--red, green, and yellow. Red was at the top. Green was at the bottom. Yellow was in the middle. He looked at the crosswalk sign. It was red. It was a red hand. The red hand meant Don't Walk. He waited for the red hand to change. It changed to a white figure walking. The white figure walking meant Walk. Jimmy looked both ways. Then he walked across the street. He walked in the crosswalk.
