Madison recently got her driving license. She is happy. She has a lot of freedom now. She can go anywhere. She doesn't have to walk to school anymore. She can drive to her friends' house. Madison has a younger sister named Lisa. Lisa is 14 and has school at eight o'clock in the morning. Madison's parents asked her to drive Lisa to school every morning. "Why do I have to wake up?" Madison asked. "Having a license means having more responsibilities," her mom replied. Her parents also asked her to pick up groceries. Madison did not like having a license anymore.
