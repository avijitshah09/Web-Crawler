In the United States, you can pretty much vote for who you want to be President if you are 18 years or older and a U.S. citizen. People don't realize how great this is. In some countries, power is passed on to relatives, and the people don't get a say in who the leader of the country should be. However, a lot of people in the United States, especially young people, do not vote.

There are many reasons why people don't vote. Firstly, they don't believe their vote matters. The truth is, everyone's vote matters! Secondly, they don't think that anything will change if they vote. Although, it's hard to see big changes right away, the presidential candidate you vote for affects many policies. Thirdly, people are lazy to go out of their house to vote. This is the worst excuse.

People need to realize that voting is a privilege. Imagine if we couldn't vote. We would feel out of the loop. We would feel that our opinion doesn't matter. If you don't vote for a candidate, then you have no right to complain about the president who will be elected.
