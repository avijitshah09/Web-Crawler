Virginia wanted to hang out with Claudia. They had not seen each other in four years. Virginia called Claudia. "Hey, it's me, Ginny!" she said. "Wow! I have not seen you for a long time," Claudia said. "Want to get lunch at IHOP?" Virginia asked. "I'm sorry I have class," Claudia said. Virginia was sad. They said good-bye.

Virginia went to IHOP with another friend. Before she went inside, she saw Claudia walk by. She was surprised. Claudia had lied to her. "I thought you had class," Virginia said. "Uh...I... did I say that?" she said. "Forget it. I would never want to hang out with a liar," Virginia said.
