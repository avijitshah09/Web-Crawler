He practiced baseball almost every day. He practiced throwing the baseball. He practiced catching the baseball. He practiced hitting the baseball. He practiced pitching the baseball. He slept with his baseball glove. His baseball glove was under his pillow. At night he dreamed about baseball. He dreamed about playing for the Yankees. He played on his high school team. He played on his college team. His coaches loved Paul. They said he was going to be a baseball player. Then Paul was in a car accident. It was a bad accident. Paul couldn't walk. His doctors said he would never walk again. Paul said, "I will walk again. I will run again. I will play baseball for the Yankees."
