Laura always had really long hair. It went all the way down to her back. It was difficult to maintain. It took her 20 minutes to wash her hair. It was also hard for her to exercise since her hair was always flying around everywhere. Laura decided to cut her hair all the way to her ear. She wanted very short hair. She also wanted to donate her hair to cancer patients. Laura always felt strongly about cancer. Her mom died from breast cancer.

The hair stylist asked Laura if she was sure that she wanted to cut her hair. Laura nodded. When the hair stylist was finished, Laura looked down to the floor. There was so much hair! Laura couldn't wait to go to school and show off her new look. When Laura met up with her friends, they looked shocked. "What do you think?" she asked. Her friends were silent. "It looks good," one of them said. He was lying.

During lunch time, Laura overheard one of the mean girls say that no guy would ever want to date her because of her manly hair cut. Laura was hurt, but she didn't care, because she knew that she cut her hair for a good cause.
