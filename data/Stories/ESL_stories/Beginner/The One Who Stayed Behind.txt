Darcy was in her 6th year of college. Most people go to college for four years and then graduate. Darcy was different. She did not plan well. In her first year, she was so excited to be away from her parents. She went out late every night. She drank too much alcohol. She made friends with the bad crowd. She skipped her classes. She had to retake a lot of classes.

In her second year, Darcy started to get her act together. She stopped going out so late. She became friends with people who studied. She went to class and studied. However, Darcy wanted to change her major from chemistry to political science. The chemistry classes she took were useless now. She had to take political science classes she should have taken in her first year.

In her third year, Darcy took more classes than the average student. It was very stressful. She was in class from 7 a.m.- 6 p.m. She felt like she could not think in any of her classes. She was not getting much sleep. She talked to a guidance counselor, who told her that she should drop two classes. The counselor also said that it was better to get good grades and stay longer in college than to get bad grades and graduate on time. Darcy dropped two classes and had to stay in college for two extra years.
