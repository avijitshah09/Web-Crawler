Tina was walking to work. She tripped on something. She looked down. It was a wallet. It was black. There were stripes on it. She opened the wallet. There was over $300 inside. There were two credit cards. There were also several receipts. This person shopped a lot.

Tina pulled out the owner's driver's license. It was her old friend Claire! Tina hadn't talked to her in a long time. There was no phone number on the license. Tina could not contact Claire. Tina went to the Lost and Found. She dropped the wallet in the box. She hoped Claire would get the wallet.
