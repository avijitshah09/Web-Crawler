Angie Walker was going on a date. Her make-up was done. Her outfit was perfect. There was still one big problem. Her hair looked terrible.

She had already spent one hour brushing it. It still wasn't looking any better. Angie's date was picking her up in half an hour. "I don't know what to do!" she screamed to her mother. "Try curling it," suggested her mother. Angie turned on the straightener and wrapped her hair around it. Suddenly, she smelled something nasty. Her hair was burning! As she pulled the straightener away, a big chunk of hair fell off. "This is a sign," cried Angie. "I'm cancelling my date!"
