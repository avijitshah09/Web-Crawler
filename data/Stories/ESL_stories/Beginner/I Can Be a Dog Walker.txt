Donna got an idea. "I can be a dog walker!" she said. One of her friends was a dog walker. She heard that dog walkers can make a lot of money just for hanging out with puppies.

"You can't do that," said her boyfriend. "Why not?" asked Donna. "You hate dogs!" he answered. This was true. Donna denied it. She really wanted an easy way to make money.

On her first day of dog walking, she had five customers. Donna had no idea dogs were so strong. They dragged her down the street running. Donna lost hold of their leashes. She lost the dogs, and all her customers in one day.
