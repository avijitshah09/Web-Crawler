The Adam family was going on a road trip. They were driving from California to Utah. They were going to see the Grand Canyon. The family got bored on the ride there. The dad suggested they play music. They played music that the whole family liked. After a while, the mom suggested they play a game.

They played the alphabet game. Each person would say an animal that started with a letter of the alphabet like ant, bat, cat, dog, and so on. They changed the topic after they went through the whole alphabet. They did names, places, and people. After that, they just talked about what they would do at Utah. They had fun conversations and laughs.
