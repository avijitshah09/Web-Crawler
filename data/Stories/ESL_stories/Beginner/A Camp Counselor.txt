Sarah was going to be a camp counselor this year. She loved working with kids. This year, however, the camp was having middle schoolers. She was nervous. She had never worked with middle school kids. She did not want them to hate her. She met them the next day. They were not as she expected at all. She expected them to be mean. She thought they would hate her. They were all really nice. They were all just excited to be at the camp. By the end of the camp, she thought of them as friends. They all looked up to her. She was sad to leave.
