Samantha could not see clearly what the teacher wrote on the board. She told her mom about it. Her mom told her it was time to get her eyes examined and get new glasses. She went to her eye doctor. After waiting for her name to be called, she saw the doctor. The eye doctor tested her eyes out. Samantha picked out a frame. She tried the new glasses and saw perfectly.

The new glasses were ready for her to pick up. She was excited. The next day in class, she was able to see everything clearly. Samantha now remembers to check her eyes every year.
