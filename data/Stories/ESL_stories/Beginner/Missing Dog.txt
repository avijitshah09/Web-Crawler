Phillip's dog had died. He had owned the dog for four years. He loved him so much. Phillip was devastated. Phillip's six-year-old daughter loved the dog even more. "Oh no," said Phillip. "This is going to break her heart!" He did not want to tell his daughter such sad news.

Phillip decided to lie. He told his daughter that their dog ran away. The girl cried for hours. Phillip took her to the dog pound to check if they had their dog. Their dog was obviously not there. However, there were a lot of other cute puppies. Phillip and his daughter took a new pet home.
