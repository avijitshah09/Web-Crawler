Taylor wanted a new hobby. He enjoyed looking at flowers. He decided to try planting some flowers himself. Gardening looked easy and relaxing.

First, he tried planting some orchids. After one week, they dried up. Taylor was confused. He had watered them every day. He did not give up. Next, he planted a rose bush. After one week, caterpillars had eaten the whole plant. Taylor still tried again. He planted some beautiful petunias. After one week, they were killed by weeds.

He was not a good gardener. "Wow," thought Taylor. "This is harder than it looks." He decided to go back to watching TV in his free time.
