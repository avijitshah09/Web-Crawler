It was Easter Sunday. Mom gave a little basket to Michelle. Mom told her to look for Easter eggs. The Easter eggs were in the back yard. "What do Easter eggs look like?" Michelle asked. Mom said, "They look just like regular eggs. But they are colored. They are red. They are blue. They are yellow. They are many different colors." "Why are they red? Do they come from red hens?" Michelle asked. "No," Mom said. "They are red because Daddy and I colored them red. They are blue because we colored them blue. They are yellow because we colored them yellow." Michelle asked, "Why did you color the eggs?" Mom said, "It's an Easter tradition. A tradition is something people do every year." Michelle went into the back yard. She found six Easter eggs. "Next year you can help us color the eggs," Mom said. "Oh, yes!" said Michelle.
