Jenny White loved her cats. She owned six of them. Jenny spent all her days with the cats. Her friends worried about her. "You should go out more," they said. "I can't stand leaving my cats alone," replied Jenny.

One day, Jenny met a man at work. He was funny and handsome. Jenny started going out with him a lot. She thought he was perfect. Jenny invited him to her house. She was very excited. "He's going to love my cats!" she thought.

The man walked into her house. He started sneezing. He couldn't breathe. He was allergic to cats. "I hate cats!" he screamed.
