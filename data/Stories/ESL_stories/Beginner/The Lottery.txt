Josh won the lottery. He is now a millionaire. He couldn't believe it. He could buy so many things now. First, he paid off his student loans. He was finally free of debt. He then bought a ticket to Hawaii. He also bought tickets for his best friends.

They all went to Hawaii together. They didn't worry about money when they were there. Josh stayed in the nicest hotel. He ate the fanciest food. He flew back home first-class. He had about $800,000 left. He decided to put it all in his bank account. He didn't want to go too crazy.
