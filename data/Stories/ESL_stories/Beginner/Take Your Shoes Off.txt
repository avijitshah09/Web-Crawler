Hilary went to Bree's house. Bree's older sister, Lia, stared at Hillary. Hilary was confused. Why did Lia look so mad? Lia whispered something to Bree. Bree nodded her head. Lia left the house. Bree told Hilary that her shoes were still on. Hilary was confused. Bree explained. Guests should take off their shoes when inside someone's house.

Hilary was surprised. She had no idea. She always wore shoes inside the house. She didn't want to get her feet dirty. She didn't want to argue with Bree though. She said sorry. Bree told Hillary to apologize to Lia. Hilary called Lia and said sorry. Lia said it was okay.
