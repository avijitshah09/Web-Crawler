She took her little dog for a walk. It was just a walk. Barker didn't have to poop. He had already pooped that morning. They walked by Moonbucks. People were sitting outside Moonbucks. People were drinking coffee. People were eating muffins. People were reading newspapers. People were using their computers. It was a warm, sunny day. Suddenly, Barker stopped. He squatted. He pooped on the sidewalk. He pooped in front of everyone. He pooped in public. "Barker! Shame on you!" she yelled. She ran into Moonbucks. She went into the bathroom. She grabbed a paper toilet seat cover. She went back outside. She picked up the poop with the paper toilet seat cover. She took the poop back inside. She flushed it down the toilet. She asked the Moonbucks clerk for a large cup of hot water. She poured it on the brown spot on the sidewalk.
