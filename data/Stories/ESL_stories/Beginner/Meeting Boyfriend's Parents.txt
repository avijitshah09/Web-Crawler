Margaret was going to meet her boyfriend's parents for the first time. She was worried that they wouldn't like her because she was poor. They probably thought she was with him for his money. She wasn't. She was with him because he was kind and funny. Margaret had to look her best. She put on her nicest dress, heels, and diamond earrings. Margaret's boyfriend, Jimmy, picked her up. "You'll be fine," he said.

When she saw Jimmy's parents' house, she gasped. It was huge! There were two security guards at the two ends of the gate. They typed in the code and the gate opened. When they got to the front door, the servant opened the door for them. Margaret and Jimmy went into the living room to find Jimmy's parents drinking expensive wine. It was the kind of wine that was $100 a bottle. "Mom. Dad. This is Margaret," Jimmy said. Jimmy's mom looked at Margaret from top to bottom and frowned. Jimmy's dad did the same. Margaret was not off to a good start.

The four of them sat at the dining table. Nobody said anything for ten minutes. Margaret broke the silence and said, "This is delicious!" "Of course it is, it's probably the most expensive thing you ever ate,"Jimmy's mom said. "Mom, that was really mean," Jimmy said. "I'm just saying the truth, son." Margaret and Jimmy left after dinner. Margaret swore she would never see his parents again.
