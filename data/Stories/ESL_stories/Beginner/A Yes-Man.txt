Paul tried hard to please everyone and had a hard time saying no to anything. When people asked him to do exciting things, Paul said yes, so people would think he's a fun guy. He also said yes to exciting things because he thought life was too short to not try new things. When people asked him to do favors for them, Paul said yes because he wanted people to like him.

His agreement to everything was a big problem when he was busy with homework, chores, or any other personal commitments. One time he had a test that was worth 50% of his final grade, and the day before it, he decided to go skydiving with his neighbor. Skydiving took about five hours, and Paul couldn't get home until 11 p.m. By then he was tired and found it hard to focus on studying.

Another time Paul's friend asked if he could turn in her paper for her at 3 p.m. Paul had to be at his soccer game at 3:10 p.m. Any other person would have said no, but not Paul. Paul turned in the paper for his friend, ran to the gym to change, and then arrived at the soccer game 10 minutes late.
