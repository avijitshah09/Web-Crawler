A rudementary version for developing focussed web crawler. It is developed with the motivation of building such a corpus that carries the knowledge which is very obvious to humans and are very much related to our everyday life. KNEWS, an open source by INRIA is run on this corpus to generate more than 268,000 relation triples.

We crawled and extracted more than 1600 stories(short, medium, big) provided by ESL[1] and UVCS[2] websites.
